This is the Natural Language Processing (NLP) project for [Data Science 3: Unstructured Text Analysis](https://courses.ceu.edu/courses/2020-2021/data-science-3-unstructured-text-analysis) course at CEU [Master of Science in Business Analytics](https://courses.ceu.edu/programs/ms/master-science-business-analytics) program. 

This project is related to topic modeling. As a data source, I chose Upwork - an American freelancing platform where freelancers and clients connect in order to conduct business.

In Upwork Community forum, people publish their questions in the form of posts. There are separate pages for different members: freelancers, clients, agencies, first-timers.

Each post has title & content. I scraped these Upwork forum posts and and planned to label each post with topics using **topic modeling**. I also made a **sentiment analysis** using this data.
