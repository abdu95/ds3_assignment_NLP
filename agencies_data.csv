	Why am I still not getting my top rated badge?
","May 17, 2021  02:01:25 AM","
Hi!     I received my first top-rated badge a few months ago and lost it due to my past 12-months earning being less than $1000.  Meanwhile, I also started an agency and have been getting jobs through that. My problem is, On my personal account, my earnings are now above $1000 for a month but I still haven't received my badge.  Can I know the reason for this? Is it due to the fact that my new jobs are through my agency and not my own profile? or is it because my latest jobs haven't been closed and are still in progress.  Sincerely, Muhammad Ahmad Shah

","May 14, 2021  09:44:46 AM","
Hey! I am a freelancer in Upwork. I would like to start an agency. In my vision I would like to have send offers for jobs on behalf of my agency and accept work for my agency. After accept the work I would like to assign 1 of my team members for the job. So basically I will be kind a job manager that will assign members within the agency for jobs that I will get for my agency. Is it possible to do that in any way? I understood that this kind of work may be possible on fixed price jobs and not hourly, is that right?Can I send offers as an agency or I need to do it as a freelancer in the agency?The feedback for the work will be on the agency profile or the freelancer profile? Thanks!

Or everything I do will be as an agency from the moment I create the agency profile?  I'm asking because I've read a lot of job postings where clients specifically say ""No Agencies"", and I still want to be able to apply for those jobs as an independant freelancer and not a part (or owner) of an agency.  Any information on this will be very helpful.  Thank you!

	Assigning Multiple Freelancers to a Contract
","Apr 17, 2020  09:11:01 PM","
Good day, I have been working on Upwork as an individual freelancer and have recently started an agency with my colleague (we'd like to be able to deploy each other's expertise collaboratively). This is our first foray into using an agency account. After extensive research, I have concluded that it is not possible to assign hourly contracts to be logged by multiple freelancers in one agency (although it is possible to do this internally with fixed-rate contracts). Is this understanding correct? If so, I'd like to strongly suggest that Upwork make progress on adjusting this functionality to align with the way agencies actually perform and bill work. I came across posts as old as almost a year with people complaining about this. If I indeed understand this correctly, I'm not certain I wish to retain our agency account, as the benefit seems limited relative to simply purchasing Freelancer Plus (which at least comes with monthly connects).  Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you!

	How to add proper billing details of the person I'm working with at Upwork?
","May 10, 2021  10:22:30 AM","
Since a year I was working with one freelancer at Upwork and happy to continue to work with him still.The problem is his billing details went missing since every of the invoices Upwork generates.Apart of the fee invoice that Upwork generates, the normal services invoices are basically FROM a freelancer himself as a person. So I show to my tax/accounting invoices from a private individual/freelancer/enterpreneur, not from an Upwork. And in some countries rise questions who that person is and if they has to apply extra VAT for that. As a result, my accountin/tax dept. doesn't accept those and only reason of acceptance will add 21% extra VAT (Spain) because it is not clear if the freelancer is Spanish (or EU) resident because his billing details are missing or simply forgot to fill in. That's called double taxation and I already have a letter from that freelancer that he is a tax resident from another country to avoid double taxation but his billing details still missing. Is there a way to adjust past invoices with proper billing details or if the freelancer will update them?What if he will refuse to fill his billing details (e.g. he may have own reasons)?I like working with proper people and fast billing via Upwork but the lack of absolute ticket support and direct from freelancers invoices generation are horrible for the companies in some countires.

	Decrease in number of invites and responses to job posts
","May 9, 2021  09:33:25 PM","
Hi, We have been an agency focused on IoT solutions development since we joined Upwork in 2015. With 121 projects later, we used to get at least one invite per day and the response rate to our job applications were around 60 to 70%. All this suddenly changed in April 2021. We are not getting as many invites - the ones we get are mostly small and irrelevant, we are not getting any response to our bids. The only area where we are getting responses is where the client has a very low budget and where our LoRa-Chirpstack skill matches. Basically we got just one relevant response.From 60 % to nearly 0 is hitting us hard. Just checking if anyone else is facing this issue. Being a company with 30 people working, this sudden change is affecting us badly. We are an end to end IoT solutions development company and anyone chacking our profile can see the number of projects we have done successfully in the area. Now we are not getting any response to bids in the very same area, where clients used to be impressed with the number of projects we had done in IoT. Waiting to hear if anyone else is facing this issue. Thanks, Sheeba

	Anti-Agency Bias and how to anticipate it
","May 4, 2021  11:59:11 PM","
Hi there! We are a young startup digital agency, and have founded an agency in Germany as part of our entrepreneurship studies, and have already worked successfully with many local customers. We claim we are young, innovative and flexible, and open to new opportunities and new markets. We are currently considering building our agency on Upwork as well, as this is a very viral platform with many potential areas of activity and customers, and I myself have already had a good experience here as a freelancer.  But now I have read a lot about the aversions many people felt about agencies on Upwork, and I would like to know more about it. I'm not scared to hear your honest opinion and your worst experiences with agencies. Only through this we can anticipate client’s apprehensions to agencies and make sure we deliver the best solutions to the client’s fullest satisfaction.  So: 1. Why clients often want to stay clear of agencies? 2. What are your worst experiences with agencies?3. Why are there agencies still on Upwork, what advantages do they offer customers? I would be very grateful for your honest and ruthless opinion. Perhaps that way we can implement our project more successfully on Upwork, but perhaps we also decide against opening an agency afterwards. Thank you so much!

Returned back ""100% working"" templates - still the same- 2-3 months ago, we have had 5-7 replies to job posts per week, which we've considered being our regular results on the platform for a long time now (until recently).- We don't see anything changed in the number of jobs created or us replying, or our rating, or anything else we could think of... Has anyone experienced similar? Maybe we're blocked somehow or need to do anything differently? Any help is much appreciated.  Thanks,StepanCEO CookieDev

	Agency Time Logging
","May 1, 2021  05:46:11 PM","
Hello everyone!  Long time listener, first time caller  I have been on Upwork for a while as a freelancer and thinking of creating an Agency. I have a few friends that I feel we could form a good group and get good jobs and work done here. So since I will be the main person on here, I will be the Manager and help them come on (not all are in Upwork yet). My first question that I can't find an answer to is: Ok, if I bring them on to an existing job I have, they will need to be hired through the agency but individually by the client I get that part. For payment. Let's say they charge $10usd/hr. I will be providing some work tools and etc (office, computer, internet, vpn, etc.) and I was thinking of charging $1usd/hr for work they get through the agency. The client would hire and they would see $11 obviously because they would be paying it. My freelancer would see $10 or $11? Or would they negotiate the rate directly? I wouldn't like for my client ""John"" to be negotiating hourly rates with ""Carl"" my freelancer since I would want to make sure we are all paid the same (when on same contracts of course) and I know I would get paid and then distribute for my staff because yes they need to log individual hours (hence the individual hiring through the agency) and no I'm not trying to overbill anyone lol I know it might look that way  but for example if we hire someone else locally for the agency, maybe it's not ideal for them to see that $1usd? Just brainstorming here and thank you for the help!   Sorry if I made it sound a bit confusing lol

	Can I log in to timer in Upwork freelance profile and agency profile at the same time.?
","May 3, 2021  08:21:26 AM","
I am on upwork for 2 years. I have a small agency as well. I have a freelancer profile on upwork which is associated with my agency profile. I am working for a client for like 8 months now on my freelancer profile and I had another job offer that is colliding with the same time frame of my ongoing job. I suggested to the new client that he can have one of my agency's freelancer onboard and he's ok with it as far as my agency's person meet with his standards and job eligibility. My question is can I have my agency's person hired on my agency's profile when I am hired on the freelancer's profile .? And will we both be able to use the upwork desktop timer at the same time for different works if I am using freelancer profile associated with agency and he's using my main agency's profile .?

	How do you make money as an Agency Owner?
","Feb 22, 2019  03:19:07 PM","
Hello there, I am considering creating an Agency and I have read the basics, however, I have failed to find out information how an Agency Owner can make money from finding jobs to team of freelancers. Often times I have to decline projects due to lack of time or I just simply need assistance in some areas. In a non uncommon scenario (at least in real life) one sub-contract intermediate contractors then you polish the areas where needed to. So, if I charge $50 an hour I would find a freelancer who can do the job, under my supervision for let say $40, earning myself an income of $10 which accounts for finding the job, supervising it and being accountable person. How does it work on the Upwork Agency and how do I income out of the Agency Owner position?

	Agency members responding to proposals
","Apr 30, 2021  04:31:02 AM","
Hi there, I tried to start an agency before but had to drop it because when I send proposals, I thought only the business manager can directly communicate with the client. However, what was happening is that the client would respond to the proposal and the freelancer can see it and respond to it. They then talk about the job and the freelancer declines it without negotiating first.  Is there a way that the interview gets through the business manager only? I want to restart the agency but I am not sure how to remedy this problem. Do I have to make them all exclusive members? Thank you!

	How to delegate project tasks to agency freelencers?
","Apr 28, 2021  09:33:26 AM","
I've been researching this topic and it seems that the community at large is uncertain how to do this. I could use some clarity in this subject as well to make sure I can grow my business and not inadvertently get kicked off Upwork.The way I understand elements of how an Agency works are the following:The only way to delegate aspects of a project is to have fixed-price contracts, but in hourly the client has to individually hire each freelancer working on the project. This eliminates the purpose in having a team with a manager where the client only has to liaise with the team lead. I understand the legal distinction of an 'Agency' but the fact stands that some contracts are better set as hourly. In my experience from what clients are asking for, this is an option that needs to be added. In effect, the client is hiring the team and it is the team's hourly that is set for the contract. In Upwork's defense, this does seem like a complicated problem to solve.In order for the hourly projects to happen, as I understand it, the freelancers have to be exclusive? I think the main draw to freelancing is the freedom, and I'd love the opportunity to have non-exclusive freelancers on my roster to delegate project aspects as project lead. So this would more or less take on a project/freelancer management feature. From what I gather, this feature was available in the past but was removed from abuse - totally understandable. But we still need an effective way to manage a team with both hourly and fixed-price contracts. Think how law firms have teams of lawyers and bill the clients for all the hours through one contractual relationship (loose analogy). As a software developer, my clients know how the development process works and they know that one can't possibly understand the granular details of a project until we're knee deep. This is why many of my clients prefer hourly - so they know they are providing us with what we're owed. Especially projects that take many months and require delegation to effectively deliver.  Please correct me if I'm misunderstanding how agencies work on Upwork. Currently, I don't see much benefit to having an agency other than 'it looks good' if a significant number of clients want hourly contracts, unless the Agency feature is only made for fixed-price.  Thanks in advance,Jameson EDIT: If anyone has any suggestions or helpful workarounds please comment. I'm always willing to learn.

","Apr 3, 2021  08:41:18 PM","
The reply which I received from the Customer Support team can be found below; however, the reply is not based on the facts.
 
Let me clarify that the **Edited for Community Guidelines** was part of the team when she submitted the proposal. However, the Submitted Proposal count was 0, even when she was part of the **Edited for Community Guidelines** team and she already submitted the proposal. And I was not able to see any submitted proposal.
 
Then the **Edited for Community Guidelines** told me that when she submitted the proposal, it was submitted from her profile, but not the **Edited for Community Guidelines** profile; although she selected the **Edited for Community Guidelines** account while submitting it. I think she is right because the connects were reduced from the **Edited for Community Guidelines** connects count but not from her account. Then we thought that if she leaves the team temporarily, then probably the submitted proposal starts appearing in the **Edited for Community Guidelines** account.
 
I am not asking you to return the connects; it's okay if they are lost. The problem is that if the **Edited for Community Guidelines** joins the team again; and then if she submits another proposal then how can she make sure that the proposal is submitted from the **Edited for Community Guidelines** account and the submitted proposal also shows in the **Edited for Community Guidelines** account.
 
Please guide us on this issue as early as possible because our work is currently stopped.

","Apr 2, 2021  09:52:21 AM","
I added a Business Development Manager in my Upwork Agency account. Then I purchased 40 connects so that the BDM can apply for the jobs. But when the BDM applies for the first job, the connects count went below to 36 but the proposals section was showing that there is no proposal submitted and I being an agency owner dont see where the submitted proposal is and what are the updates on the submitted proposal.  Some screenshots are attached herewith in support of my problem statement above. Please guide to fix this issue.

A freelancer stated to me in a message on Upwork that he is part of an agency. Why would an individual freelancer not disclose that he is part of an agency on his profile? Is there a rule on Upwork that requires a freelancer to register as an agency?

	Payment Not Received from Agency Account - I suspect Last 4 digits of my account went missing
","Mar 23, 2021  10:57:12 PM","
Hi support, I transferred $173 from my agency account to my local account in the morning. But after initiating the transfer I noticed that Upwork has truncated the last 4 digits of my local bank account number and I never received the amount while on the other hand, I also initiated the transfer of $319 from my freelance account and it received perfectly.Now the issue is, I suspect that the last four digits on my agency account are missing (which was not the case when I created this payment method) so does it mean that I have lost my hard-earned money? or there is a way to roll it back and re-process?Thanks

	Payment On Upgrading To Agency
","Apr 1, 2021  01:42:56 AM","
Hi!  Love to work with Upwork and find it's a great platform to be!   I'm having an individual freelancer account at the moment and have plan to upgrade to agency account but I have this question below.  In term of payment, it takes about 12 days waiting period after the billing cycle ends for a freelancer account. I remember I read some where else (sorry, can't show you the link), it taks about 20 days waiting period after billing cycle ends. My question whether will I be treated the same if I upgrade it to agancy account ? Look forward to receiving your reply soon.   

	Your sincerely,Johny L.

	Money question when closing agency
","Oct 9, 2020  03:09:29 AM","
Hello! I would like to know if it is possible to transfer money on my agency account to my freelancer account in case I close the agency. The problem is that lately it’s been very hard to find good projects (they are either very cheap or not for our style), so these several months I am just losing money for upwork month agency fee. I want to work now as independent freelancer to take only that rare good projects. I hope not to loose all my money, because I already pointlessly lost much waiting for projects that will fit. That’s why I will really appreciate, if upwork could transfer my agency money to my freelancer account, when I close my agency. Thank you in advance!

	Translator on my Video Identity Verification
","Mar 29, 2021  02:33:16 PM","
Hello! I am writing with regards to my upcoming verification. My English is poor and I am afraid I won’t be able to answer questions as fully as required.  So I hired a translator to help me handling it. I am familiar with ToS, so I made everything to prevent violating it. I have provided my own accurate and verifiable information with a clear photo of myself. Translator helps us screen out all the potential jobs on Upwork and then translate the job descriptions to me, so then I will decide whether we can do it or not.If we are up for the jobs, then he will write a proposal in accordance to my ideas and use the Agency Account to submit the proposal on my behalf; he’s payed to do all of this work. And after receiving a reply from a client, I will give the translator any English messages the client sent and have him translate them into Azerbaijani for me. Then I will tell him what to reply in Azerbaijani and he then will translate that into English. He gives me the English text and I copy the text into the Message and send it to the client. The process will go back and forth. The account is controlled by me only and the translator is just responsible for translating the communications. We work at the same company and sometimes I ask him to sit next to me to help me with the translation or through other messaging apps we use in Ukraine. The profile's account name and password are controlled by me; no one else knows it. We are not trying to do any rule-violating activities, we just want to expand our business overseas through Upwork because we have heard that it has great potential for business development and it is the best platform out there.So I really would like to pass this interview with my translator joining me. Please, let me know if it is possible.Best regards,Cuma Huseinov

	Possible discrimination and diversity prevention threat from Upwork

Here is the situtation.My client (who spent couple of millions on platform) challenged me to find exceptional tallent to fulfill our team. As owner of our agency I have spent a few thousands dollars to find and keep spending the same amount each month to pay sallary. I have spent two months (paying sallary) to ensure that he has skills that we need, I negotiated contract for him and now Upwork says that he is not a good fit for platform (without any explanation why), although the only thing Upwork is required to do in this situation is to provide us payroll paltform and collect fee. Dear Upwork, I don't really have to work with this client through Upwork and can legally go out and work directly along with other developers. The only thing I really want is to get good explanation of this situtation. Upwork keeps being unresponsive and unclear. I am really woried that Upwork moderators can use this instrument to discriminate people for political, gender or rasist (although I can't really imagine this!) reasons. This process doesn't really work good, please explain.

If I try to see who has viewed profile (being agency owner) it says, I do not have permission to view that.

I expected to get the contracts from my Clients and distribute some of the tasks to my team members and pay less than the contract price is. Neither my Clients nor I am interested in having my Client hire my agency members. I see no way in creating contracts with my team members and paying them for certain tasks while I get the full payment for my contract. They want me to be accountable for the project and don't care who will help me.I haven't used the agency for my perposes. Is it possible to get refund for the upgrading? When I tried to close the agency I received the following note ""In order to close an Agency, please contact customer service"".

	Negative Balance After Gave Refund
","Mar 9, 2021  02:42:10 PM","
So, I had a contract under my agency profile. after I spent 10 hours on that project the client thought that my approach to work is not they way he wanted. So, I refunded him that amount and the contract continues after we discuss the correct approach. After I refunded him, I am seeing $79 in negative in my agency earnings. And when I log hours for my other contract under same agency (which I own), the earned amount for those hours is added to negative balance which means I had $79 in negative, I earned $10 from another hourly job and it got added in my negative balance, example:  -79+10 = -$69 Why is my balance is negative when I have already refunded the amount that I earned? If the refunded amount was already deducted and deposited in the client's account then what is this negative balance all about?  Thanks

	Accidentally hired through the agency that has a suspended financial account
","Mar 8, 2021  05:52:14 AM","
Hi community,  Hope someone can help me to make sure there won't be any problems after I accidentally accepted a contract as an agency member instead of my individual profile. The agency is created&owned by me, but it's not active for now since for some reason I cannot pay the agency fee through Paypal (which is weird coz when I created it, that's how I paid) and I don't have any other methods of payment available at the moment. So its financial account is suspended, but I'm not bothered since anyway it's on hold for now because I don't have time to work on it. I didn't think clients could hire through the agency at all if its financial account is suspended (I thought that deactivates the agency completely). The issue is, when I was hired for my last project (as an individual freelancer), somehow accidentally the contract was made through the agency. So the payment will then go to the agency account instead of my individual one, right? Can I then withdraw it or do I have to pay the agency fee first in order to withdraw the earnings? If I do, can I do it with the money that I will earn from the project (instead of paypal or bank account)? Also, just to double-check, when I finish the project and the client leaves a review, it will go to my personal profile as well, right? Not just to the agency's profile? If I then eventually decide to close the agency, the feedback will stay in my profile? Or maybe someone knows if there's an easy way to just transfer the contract from me as a member of the agency to me as an individual freelancer? If I ask the client to close the current contract and create a new one to fix this, I'm afraid somehow it might hurt my JSS or whatever.

That is starnge to see that agency earnings are being shown in members profile specially when is performing his job with agency. Either show the earning in his profile after the closure of the contract, there is no issue regarding hours. If we are showing Agency earnings in member profile also, then there is no advantage of are point of hiding Rates from him, such purpose has been lost due to disclosure in his profile earning.He can easily calculate the rate and total earning specially one member is new. There should be proper mechanism to address this.

Hi, Upwork community. We have a client from the Upwork and he's willing to give us a new project, however, the specialist selected by the client is not able to get his profile approved. I already added him as an exclusive agency member, but he's not available in team members list and client is not able to send him an offer.I tried to contact support via email, but it turns into a ping-pong messaging with templated answers. I ask support how to solve the issue and they say that freelancer should contact them directly. On his direct request (with mentioning of the client and a job waiting for him) he gets a templated reply that there is no place for him here for now. Then I contact support again, describe the issue with auto-reply that freelancer is getting, get the reply that my request is forwarded to the appropriate deprtment and later getting same templated reply that freelancer should contact them directly. Seems like a loop. Will appreciate if support or the dedicated team that reviews profiles could please review his profile for approval. Either please share the contacts of the dedicated team. We have agreed on some deadlines with the client and there is marketing budget already planned upon project release, so this delay really makes our and client's life harder now. I will be glad if any assistance can be provided to help verify our specialist profile and ensure the collaboration with the client is successful.

I want to start an Upwork Agency for the free. After that, I'll upgrade if I want, just like Upwork freelancer basic (free) and plus account ($14.99 USD per month). 3- Can I change my Agency Name later (if I want)?Your response will be highly appreciated.Thanks & Regards

	Agency Work History_ How Remove a non-related job
","Feb 21, 2021  05:49:28 AM","
Hi Dear Upworker,I'm one of our agency business managers. One of our ""agency-member"" bided on a translation job by our agencies connects and unfortunately I didn't realize it while I was accepting the offer from the client. Although she got 5star feedback from clients and the job has been closed, this job was out of our domain (IT and Development), it has been granted as a work-history on the agency's main page.Since this job accidentally was bided by our agency's credit, it had been listed as Paisley's job-history and made some inappropriate side-effects on the agency's working trends. All our previous efforts to being bold on the market of +30$/h jobs in the IT & Development category has been affected due to this happening, and unfortunately to avoid further problems we forced to remove that member's account from our agency.Many thanks in advance for your help to give a solution for removing this unrelated work-history.

	Payment Declined by client's bank - next steps?
","Feb 18, 2021  10:22:16 PM","
A client of mine hired me on upwork and we successfully completed the project. The payment (tracked in accordance with upwork hourly) was visible to be released to me in the upcoming days in my transaction history. We mutually decided to end the contract with a great feedback for each other. On the day of the payment, the bank declined the same. The payment method of the client was verified at the time of entering into the contract. Now I have completed the work and ended the contract but have no signs of the payment. We tried another contract and make a bonus payment but no success.  The client reached out to his bank (Punjab National Bank, India) and the bank declines it to upwork on the issue that upwork is an unverified source. Probably a CVV issue. 1) How should I receive the payment?2) Why does upwork show the payment in the transaction page when it has not received the same from the bank?3) What provisions does upwork make incase the bank declines such a transaction (online)?

Good Day, I trust this communication finds you safe and well. My question is this.... Can I offer my freelance skills to work for an agency, and continue with my individual freelance status ? As recently I have experienced what I would best describe as ""radio silence"" from the proposals I have submitted to clients.This has resulted in the depletion of all my connects,which now prevents me from applying for any opportunities that may become available. Respectfully... perhaps Upwork could review the required purchase of connect's,and introduce a totally free solution. It would appear this is a general area of concern for many freelancers. Your feedback would be most welcome. All things good Andre.

I became an exclusive member of an agency yesterday. Now my former client wants to re-hire me and has sent me an invitation to interview. I accepted and sent a proposal. But that's where the conundrum started: he can't send me an offer (it shows that interview is in progress, which it isn't, and that he can't send an invitation to that freelancer), and all I can do is change terms or withdraw the proposal. When I tried to propose a new contract to him, it showed an error. Are we doing anything wrong? Does he need to send an offer to the agency owner? It's me who is going to work with him, though, so I'm not sure that's the right option. Thanks in advance!

	Email invitation to join upwork agency not working.
","Feb 1, 2021  11:32:48 AM","
So I was recently added to an upwork agency as a freelancer. I received the email message invite and accepted. Now when I log into upwork, it doesn't show anything different as if nothing happened. When logging into the agency, it doesn't show me as a team member. The owner of the agency tried to resend me an invite and now I am not receiving any emial what so ever. I have checked spam and junk and nothing hit there either. Another strange thing is the original invite email is now gone. I was already a freelancer prior to this invite, is the problem that I had the agency send the invite to the same email that's already registered? Please provide input as to how I can solve this issue and get added to the agency. Thanks!

","Jan 31, 2021  11:14:32 AM","
Hi everyone, Hope you are doing well! I have a freelancer account! Now I want to convert my freelancer account to an agency account. Because I want to add more members to my team. I want to ask that creating an agency and working as an agency is paid on Upwork? Are there any fees? Secondly, right now I am working as a content writer. I want to expand my services to SEO and website development in the future. Is this is possible that in my agency I add members who work as a web developer or as SEO expert.  Or I can add members to my team only who have the same niche means they are also working as a content writer.  Further, what are the suggestions that I should keep in mind to make my agency profile successful!  Thank you so much!

	misfunctioning JOB-FEED and JOB-SEARCH tools
","Jan 24, 2020  06:19:49 AM","
We find the job-feed of upwork a bit incomplete. Upwork should help users to find their matched jobs and spend less time as much as possible. For that, there is needed just a few enchancements, which are not being implemented till date, due to unknown reasons... Mostly, the JOB-SEARCH and JOB-FEED parts - which do not function as intended, and here we provide OBVIOUS PROOFS.   PROBLEMS ABOUT JOB-SEARCHPROBLEM #1) For example, If i make a search for elevator:https://www.upwork.com/ab/jobs/search/?q=elevator&sort=recency the search results include the jobs where only elevate or elevation is mentioned. I find this annoying and inappropriate.  If we wanted, we could have searched for elevat, to match all kind of words on that base.Our job-feed is sometimes full of such inappropriate results due to such mismatches inaccuratly based from our saved job-keywords. Actually, I want my home feed only showed jobs that matches one of my saved job-keyword. How can i achieve that? using quotes """" or the ""exact match"" is not solution, because if i want jobs for example keyword, and make it with quote to be exact match (see ""example"" ) then it doesnt show jobs mentioning example.com ( see ""example.com"" ). If i make a search for example without quotes, then it will list jobs mentioning only i.e. examplication, examply or any kind of related variations. So, as you see, I've shown the proof of inacurracy. Please address it for the sake of freelancers. Keyword search is not a place, where UW should implement ""google like"" searching for variations. If user wants to have a search varying for specific base, then , as i said, s/he should search for i.e. elevat to get matches for elevation, elevator, elevate, etc... PROBLEM #2) Also, there seems to be different results while searching i.e: the below searches are quite clear what I am searching for : A) ""build"" AND (""house"" OR ""home"") [link]B) (""build"" AND ""house"") OR (""build"" AND ""home"")  [link] But they produce different amount of results, and that makes us quite confused. However, i have to combine A and B like this:( ""build"" AND (""house"" OR ""home"") )   OR   (  (""build"" AND ""house"") OR (""build"" AND ""home"")   )[ link ]and then i get somehow complete (as it seems, not sure though..) results (but even, some of results were which contained only word build and neither home or house). After a lot of efforts, i've found that when phrase is put in brackets,then inside brackets, the quotes are ignored, and that make the logic to become inaccurate when trying to make multiple searches, like above (i.e.  home AND (""ladder"" OR ""elevator"" or ""carpet"") ends with results of same: home AND (ladder OR elevator or carpet) which leads again to the main problem I described in above post. All this us, leads us to save separed query without using those brackets and OR/AND operators, like:""home"" AND ""ladder""""home"" AND ""elevator""""home"" AND ""carpet""..  but that makes us very annoying as instead of 1 nice saved query, we need to create tens of separated queries.         PROBLEMS ABOUT JOB-FEEDFor example, at this moment, we can choose ""categories"" and according to that, our home feed ( https://www.upwork.com/ab/find-work/ ) will show jobs under those categories.However, to say frankly, that is vastly generic, inconvenient and excess for specialized programmers.For example, if we want to have tasks which specifically contain words/skills jQuery, then of course, we can search for it and saved the search. then we can add i.e. Angular and Laravel... (or the sake of simplicity, lets take only these 3 keywords, actually we have to monitor 30 keyowrds or more). PROBLEM #1)When we go to our job feed, it just shows everything under IT category (if we choose it). We dont need all jobs under IT. We only want to see jobs matching those keywords. UW support suggested two things (none of them suitable though)-a) to delete the categories under our accounts (that's quite bad - why we should delete our working category? just for the sole purpose to get the correct feed? but deleting our work-category has other side-effects. It's not good way)b) to click one-by-one onto the ""saved searches"" (that's neither conveninet, we have to click so many times, as we have 10-15 ""saved searches""). So, what should be the solution? It's so simple to be implemented - just to have an option to get the feeds according only to ""saved searches"". Is that hard? absolutely no, UW devs could implement that quite easily i am sure. But till date, we are recieving the irrelevant and board jobs on our feed  - like photoshop or youtube SEO marketing or etc... which dont anywhere include our keywords. Please, fix this. We are having hard time to find the jobs that matched directly our keywords. Call it an option ""SAVED-SEARCH mode for job-feed"", which would be available as option for users. PROBLEM #2) When we get the jobs (doesnt matter if it's on job-feed page or in search), please make the matched words highlighted in the jobposting, like this example.  It doesn't work correctly on UW currently. On some cases, it highlights, but in most cases, it just doesnt highlight the keyword (neither in description, nor in skills list). Someone suggested to use BROWSER SEARCH (CTRL+F) to higlight them (as used in screenshot), but it's totally impossible to use extra browser search one-by-one. even, on JOB--FEED home, it's more impossible. So, when we use ""SAVED-SEARCH mode for job-feed""  and when we open our JOB-FEED home page, then each job should have the matched keywords of interest, highlighted. Please consider these really easy changes, which will help much. You can even ask others, and probably everyone can confirm the profitability of these functionalities.  These changes should be in WEB and mobile app too. THE MAIN thing, when developers oppose (that it might affect existing functionalities), can be eliminated  if UW retained the current functionality as is (lets call that ""MODE A""), but users can choose the other mode of search (as discussed in this topic), call it ""MODE B"". So, somewhere in our user-settings, give us ability  to choose ""MODE B"", so search worked in the way as IT SHOULD.

	Non-exclusive agency members earnings
","May 14, 2020  12:06:55 PM","
Hello,I'm as an agency manager is surprising why the profile of non-exclusive members has reflected the total earned by $ with the actual rate of the freelancer with the client?In my opinion, the agency member should have a contract with agency not with client directly as it is now. And the client should have a contract with agency, in other words, it should have the same way as it is in a normal business, for example when I'm working as an employee in a company I have a contract with the company and I know my earnings within my company but I don't know the earnings of the company with their clients. This is a very important point that should be considered with the agency settings otherwise I don't see the need to pay for agency plus.Every Freelancer has a right to search for a job within he is exclusive or non-exclusive, maybe the Upwork should have a third party that could be between exclusive and non-exclusive to meet a normal business deal?

","Jan 8, 2021  02:33:56 PM","
Hello everyone, I want to share with you all my experience if it can be usefull for anyone, and/or in case anyone can shead a light.After giving it a tought of building an agency on upwork, I decided to give it a try and this is extremely unsatisfying.I can't share my account with anyone due to Upwork policy, so I decided to create an agency to bring in a team of engineers to work with clients I have.After getting very vague responses from Upwork customer service, I decided to create an agency and get their Upwork profiles (not activated by upwork) on the agency.It turns out it is useless yo have profiles which are not activated by upwork.Upwork won't move a finger to activate them and I can't get them to start working with my clients. After reading some threads on upwork community it looks like Agencies are seen very badly by clients. It's very hard to get a client to answer to any proposal, or even to get him to answer after he has invited me to a project.... Now I find out that my agency doesn't show up if I try to look up for myself.... so the agency is invisible to clients? Upwork wont answer any of my emails, open threads, or anything on this matter....If this feature works so bad, I would like to close the agency but I can't even get to do that!!! I'm stuck paying a monthly fee on a useless agency , with useless connects I bought... I would appreciate if someone could give me some help, or if Upwork staff shows up after reading this.

	Assign Tasks to Members
","Jan 7, 2021  05:09:45 PM","
How can I assign specific tasks of a large project to team members? The only reason I started an agency was because it seemed as though I could accept larger projects and then split them up into individual tasks for my team members.  Now, it looks like I have to take the jobs personally, communicate with my team outside of UpWork to assign tasks, take the payment to my personal UpWork account, and then pay out my team through PayPal.  WHY?????? The WHOLE REASON A.N.Y.O.N.E. would open an agency is so you could assign tasks to team members and split payments between them. Now my earnings will be skewed and my team members get screwed. I can't just have a client hire my editor when he's hiring my agency for an article. We provide articles that are edited. He's hiring both of us. Some projects need all 4 of us. I'm not going to ask my client to divide all of his work into individual segments that I have no control over.

	Why are Agency Profiles completely useless?
","May 13, 2020  09:28:56 AM","
I have been working on Upwork for 3 years now and am exploring ways to scale. I decided to bring partner with a friend and create an agency. I feel like I must be missing something because I am unable to find a single useful feature that an Agency profile provides.  It seems obvious to me that, at the very least, an agency profile should be able to assign work to its agency members. Instead, Upwork forces the client to do this. The problem is that 90% of clients have never used upwork before, which means I now have to walk them through the process of setting up a second contract with my freelancer. Not only is this a huge nuisance, but it is the exact same process that I would go through if I didn't have an agency and just wanted to have my client hire a colleague. What is the point of having an agency? In addition to offering 0 value-add over normal freelancer accounts, the agency actually detracts from value by seriously hindering SEO. My friend's earnings are counted towards my agency and his account was eventually removed from search results because he had no activity, despite the fact that he had been working every week.  Only after calling to complain did Upwork inform me that there is a free agency account which at least does not charge me $20/month for nothing. This was not an option when I originally signed up.  One final note: I absolutely hate the agency reports. They are also far inferrior to the simple earnings report on normal freelancer accounts.   I have downgraded and made my friend's account ""non-exclusive"" so that he can earn on his own. However, I am still wondering what the point of the agency account is. Upwork should either eliminate this profile type so as not to waste freelancer time or make changes to make it easier to work on group projects.

	Payment to agency member from different country
","Dec 18, 2020  10:23:30 AM","
Hi There,  I understood is incase of agency - Client pays to agency's upwork account. So question is, incase of members of agency's are from different country, how can i transfer money to them. Example : Agency Owner is from India (INR currency) and agency member is from UK ( Punds currency) so how agency owner can transfer money from Upwork ( $ currency).  Option 1: Upwork has provision to transfer money from agency's account (which is $) to members upwork account ($ only)  Option 2 : I can register agency members personal bank account (may be differnet than $)  so when agency owner wants to make payment he can pay to members personal account ( which might be different than $).  Option 3: When agency'e payment recieves to its personal account ( non $), he can transfer to members personal account (non $ and not same as owners personal account currency)  As here main issue is : While transfering to different currencies, currency conversion charges might vary and can have a conflict in amounts due to and members expectations.

Hello, I have a question about the proposal submission process. We will be submitting on behalf of Upwork freelancers we have on our roster. Are they able to see all messages with the client? We don't want the rate negotiation process to be seen. How do we block certain messages from the freelancer's view?

	Agency Plus: Exclusive Freelancer vs Non-Exclusive Freelancer Handicapping
","Dec 3, 2020  08:42:31 AM","
I want to propose something and I'm asking for signatures in the comments.At this moment, there is a policy that is handicapping Agency Plus accounts.If you connect your Freelancer Account to your Agency Account and you set it to Non-Exclusive, you're unable to upgrade your Freelancer Account from Basic to Plus. As a result, you're not receiving the free connects that you should be receiving monthly. Basic is 10 & Plus would be 80 connects.Reference: https://support.upwork.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057604814-11-24-FREE-Connects-to-Do-More-on-Upwork-Here's the problem if you're paying for Agency Plus and you set your Freelancer Account to Exclusive, why aren't you getting those 80 connects that you would be receiving if you were paying for Freelancer Plus. Now, I understand that UpWork profits off the memberships, so it would be in their best interest to handicap the Agency Plus Accounts. Essentially, requiring Freelancers to set their Freelancer accounts to Non-Exclusive & double paying for Freelancer Plus & Agency Plus Accounts.However, this just doesn't make sense in my mind. Especially, if you're trying to build a name for your agency on UpWork. You'll want to run those projects through the Agency Account, not through your Freelancer Account. This is because the site just doesn't allow you to showcase your Freelance work as representation of what your Agency has accomplished. I find this to be negligent & aggregious. I think the only resolution is to provide Agency Plus accounts with the same benefits as the Freelancer Plus accounts, 80 Free Monthly Connects. It really doesn't hurt the bottom line of UpWork because lets face it, they don't care who the connects are spent on at the end of the day, whether it be Exclusive Freelancer or the Non-Exclusive Freelancer. Update: Another resolution would be that Freelancer Plus is baked into the Agency Plus owner's Freelancer Account. This just pretty much seems like a no brainer to me.So let's get those 80 Free Connects for Agency Plus accounts, let me get a second in the comments below.

	Unfair to Upwork Agency for connects
","Nov 24, 2020  08:13:42 AM","
Hello, I think its unfair to Agency that we are not getting any connect even though we are paying more than freelancers and we still not getting any connect with that payment. I am not getting why its that way. That should be reviewed. Upwork is always promoting freelancer, while ignoring agencies. Previous portal i.e. Elance was very very friendly and encourging agencies. I am not saying you do not promote freelancer but atleast treat equal.  This also means more freelancers will apply to job than agency and that means clients who wants freelancer will be benefit. and agency searching clients will not come to upwork.. really really hard to keep associate with upwork and lossing hope of finding good project for me or my team.   Please reconsider the same. Regards,Manish Etymon Technologies

	Personal vs Agency
","Nov 19, 2020  12:03:53 PM","
Hi all,I have 2 agency accounts (one for hiring and one for selling our services) and I also have a personal account that people hire me through as well. I find people would prefer to hire a person with a name and a face rather than an agency on Upwork. The feedback I have is that people feel agencies will be expensive. However, when I start to work with the client they soon realize that they will need more people to work on the project (Zoom conference for example). I hire those people through my agency account.  Then, I take the contract on my personal Upwork account and track my hours then hire my freelancers through my agency hiring account. Now I have a problem...how do I bill the client for the 3 other people who worked on their project?? If I put it on my personal account by adding some manual hours it will increase my 1099 and taxable income. Can I bill the client through my selling agency? If so how do I do that if they don't have a contract with my selling agency? Do I set one up?  I want to focus on what is best for the customer by using Upwork to secure payment from them and track time. Since I hire people all over the world I would like to keep using Upwork to hire my freelancers.  In the last 2 weeks I've secured 8 new clients and we have just completed 3 projects. I've paid my freelancers but now I'm not sure how to secure the outstanding money through Upwork without putting the hours on my own Upwork account that the client hired me through. The only solution is that I ensure the client hires me through my agency account and add the freelancers to that but that will scare many small customers away IMHO.  Let me know if you have a solution that you have used to make this all work. Thanks in advance, Gavin

Hello community,
 
I'm not happy with the result of my arbitration with the American Arbitration Association, what should I do?
the arbitration makes no sense to me, as If the arbitrator has not read the documentation and has arbitrarily selected the client for a full refund. There were expenses on my side that have not been paid, and overall I'm ending the contract with -$1000 due to expenses. So I have not only lost time developing 100% of his code but also paid for 3rd party and 3d models. I don't understand how the arbitrator has decided to return the 100% of the escrow to the client. It makes no sense, I would like to keep on forward with this case. I'm no happy with the results.anyone can help?

	No Agency Connects in New Agency Account
","Nov 10, 2020  02:57:43 PM","
Hello, I am pretty lost after spending almost all day looking for an answer to my question via the Upwork community and other forums online. I have been receiving connects in my account as a freelancer each month. Some sources say this is no longer happening and that all connects cost money and there are no free connects anymore. That's weird, because I swear I was receiving them as recently as June 2020 but maybe they were roll over connects I've had. More importantly, I opened an agency account and while fiddling around, made myself exclusively a freelancer for my own agency. Before I did this I had 20 connects. I understand the agency absorbs these when you are an exclusive freelancer. This should be fine considering I am the only freelancer in my own agency account but the 20 connects never showed up in my agency account.  So now I am unable to submit any bids and am very confused. Can anyone help me understand what happened and if there is a resolution? I have made sure I selected a plan - it's the free agency plan. Thank you!

I have lerned that for a freelancer it is important to be listed as an account holder or authorized signer on your bank account. So if I am an Agency and would like to get payments on my corporate account should the name of my Agency on Upwork be the same with its name on the invoise I send to the client .  Thank youBest regards.Will be happy to get help with this question.

We were getting payments into our paypal account from the get go, but with the change of policies by Upwork, the name of the paypal account should match the profile name, so we have a lot of money stuck in this profile that can't be retreived as there is no payment method attached to it, please advise a course of action.

	Automatically Add Agency Managers to all Agency Chats

Hello Upwork Community, We have a handful of Agency members. We'd like the Agency Owner and one of the Business Managers to be automatically added to all proposal chats.

We can do it manually, but we're looking for an automated solution. Also, if there's a help article that I somehow missed, please feel free to direct me there. ADDENDUM: We are currently submitting proposals from the Agency Owner account. We have 2 business managers. The Business Manager who submitted the proposal can see the chats between the Owner and the Client, which is great. But the other Business Manager cannot; he has to be added manually. This is the issue I'm trying to resolve (BOTH business managers should be able to see the chats). Thanks!

	Why should I pay a refund to the clients with no reviews on Upwork

Hello! I worked on an hourly contract with a client who has no reputation on Upwork. The client treated my company very bad (used bad words) and always blaming. Finally, after ~ 2 weeks, he blamed us that we did not do for him anything. (I have sent a screenshot of his rude words and a screenshot of GIT with prooves we did a great job. check my support tickets)Then the client disputed almost all work and now I have to pay the refund according to Upwork decision. Why should I spent years to became TOP rated agency and now give refunds to bad clients? Why Upwork does not support me? The refund looks really not something I expected. Yes, we did not use the app for screen snapshots but we have our own screenshots and our reputation. The client is new to Upwork. I found him on FB where he had bad comments. I just decided that we can help him and took him here. Now we have a dispute and refund. Protect me, please and stop refund. Contract ID25245985

Hy everyone!I have an agency (photo/video/gamedev/3D). Half of these services of it that we will not be able to support in further. If I'll delete the freelancers (there are no problems from them about it) that has been supported that services and will delete the services from the agency - my agency rating will fall down, I know that. And now I have a few questions:1. Which way is better - to delete the services and leave the relevant ones (50% from the whole services), or build a new agency from scratch with the relevant freelancers and services? I have a current agency rating of 87%, and for about $4K of entire earnings.2. After deleting the agency, can I use the same agency name for the new one? Yes/no/after a certain time/the same name with changes like adding ""Company"" or ""Studio""Maybe it's silly questions, but they are relevant to me for now.Thanks, and have a great day!

	My Agent  Not responding anymore
","Oct 6, 2020  11:10:53 PM","
Hello. It's my first time to ask. I recently started as a VA just last July 27 2020..
 
My Upwork account is under an agency. **Edited for Community Guidelines**.
 
I know my username and password in Upwork. I can still access it. But my biggest mistake as a newbie, I did not clarify things in the beginning. I was just so excited to work. I did not have an Upwork account before, my agent made an account for me using one of his email addresses.
 
I'm not the type of person to pry. I have integrity. Not once have I tried to open the gmail account he provided, and even if I wanted to like now, I won't be able to because of the gmail verification code that needs to be received on the mobile number associated with that email address. 
 
He said if ever in the future I want to leave the team, I will just have to make another account. BUT IT'S NOT POSSIBLE! (or so I've read). I've been doing some reading on threads in here and I've read that once approved, I cannot delete my account and to make another one since a deleted account still counts as an account.. 
 
I've also read that I can change the email associated with my Upwork BUT I have to verify the existing email associated with my Upwork account.😪😥😥. Again I might have to get verification or something on the email address he provided me.. I cannot open that gmail account.. 
 
I'm afraid if I just leave the team since he is just ghosting me, (no response to my text messages, calls, just seen zone on messenger), he might suddenly change password of the email associated with my Upwork account. 
 
You think it is possible I change my Upwork password? BUT AGAIN another dilemma, even if I do that, Upwork might send some verification details on the email associated currently to my account. 😥😥😥 
 
Im sad. We were friends (or so I thought) He coached me in cold calling. He was so surprised at my progress .In two months I got 94% rating. I was properly paid too. We talked last Sept 27.  I clearly stated I needed a job asap so while waiting for him I am looking for job openings outside Upwork.. (facebook groups,linkedin..)
 
I recently texted, tried to call him, because I wanted to say I will just leave the team and look for clients myself but just looked like a fool.no response.. nothing.
 
I hope someone can help me here to resolve my dilemma.. In this pandemic, everybody needs to survive.. My rating already dropped to 93% because I am inactive.. 
 
I hope someone can help me resolve my dilemma.. Apologies for the long message..

Hi, I created my profile and thought I filled everything out and went to go buy connects for my Agency profile and was notified that my profile is still incomplete, even though both were made a week ago. Am I missing something? Frustrating that I paid for the agency profile/agency plus, and yet still being told my profile isn't complete and that I can't buy connects (a week after upgrading).  Can anyone from Upwork let me know what is missing so I can start buying connects and submitting proposals/cover letters? Thanks and regards

According to the Upwork policy, your profile should only be used personally, and access to it should not be shared with other people, from different IP locations, etc. However, if I manage an agency profile, and my question is if I can let other people in my agency access my Upwork account?I have an office manager / virtual assistant and I want her to log into my agency account to handle our agency profile add content to it, correspond with prospects, etc. But I do not want to breach the Upwork policy. Please let me know if this is acceptable behaviour. Thanks,Danny

Hi, Upwork community, I decided to write here because I'm desperate... Let me start off by saying that I enjoy working with Upwork. It gives a lot of opportunities, one of them is to grow my own agency and I've been quite successful in doing this. Last Friday I've got a new client looking for our services. We brought a new agent with 10 years of experience in the Customer Service field. It's been five days since we are trying to approve her profile. The client already knows this agent, he wants to work with her. I just simply don't understand where the problem is coming from. The agent is ready to work, the client is waiting for her to join Upwork to start a contract and Upwork says that they don't need members with her qualification because this agent will not find a job... We, as an agency, do follow all the rules of Upwork and always bring all our clients to Upwork, however, we don't want to lose this client because of bureaucracy. Please help. Thank you.

Hi everyone.A month ago I was nominated as a Business development manager and exclusive member to one of the agencies. However, a week ago I realized that being on that position I will be unable to perform the work as a freelancer, so I asked the founder to make my a non-exclusive member.Today I have started negotiations with the client and later realised that I was having a conversation as a freelancer, not as an agency member. I think something has gone wrong as in the beginning I have checked all the settings and applied as an agency member. And if the client choses us, the Agency might have a problem starting from the payment finishing with the raiting.Please advise, what can I do to change the status of my conversation from freelancer's to an agency member. Thank you

I have a lot of small and large scale sucessful projects and I doubt it oscilates due to client's feedback. Im sure it is something else that is reason for oscilations but unsure what. If someone can take a look at my profile and let me know why this happens it would be greatly appreciated. P.S. Even I am eligible for top rated plus (and I was past week) for some strange reason I am just top rated at the moment. Thanks

	Do exclusive Agency members choose their rate when submitting proposals?
","Sep 9, 2020  02:53:55 PM","
Hi, all. We have run a small agency for some time now (just 2 business managers). We are now looking to expand and bring in an exclusive Agency member. I have a couple questions I need answered to ensure we work out an agreeable compensation arrangement for the freelancer. I already know that Agency members will see their profile rate. However, are they expected to set their proposed rate when submitting a proposal? Two cases that need to be answered:Hourly. Assume the Freelancer is an exclusive Agency member. Their profile rate is $X/hr. When they submit a proposal for an hourly contract, can they change or set the rate proposed to the client or is it automatically set at X? Who sets the rate proposed to the client for individual proposals? Does it default to $X/hr, and can the Freelancer change it?I assume as a Manager, I can revise their individual proposal to a different rate if we wish to increase or decrease the amount charged to the client. Is this correct?I already know that the Freelancer cannot see the rate charged to the client in ""My Jobs.""Fixed Rate. Who sets the fixed rate for the proposal? Does the Freelancer set it or does the proposal somehow pass through a Manager first who approves/sets the rate?Obviously, I'd like to give my new team member autonomy in submitting proposals, but we feel it is important to understand the process. As a Manager, I need to ensure they are sending proposals at a rate that is acceptable. I appreciate your thoughts and answers. Thank you.

	Starting an Agency with another Upwork Freelancer
","Aug 25, 2020  10:31:19 AM","
Dear all, I was not able to find relevant information but if you could provide me a direct link to it, I will certainly read it and not waste your time. I would be most grateful if you found some time to help me answer the following questions though: I want to start an agency with my father. He has 20+ years of experience as a pharmaceutical chemist, programmer and informatician. I thought about starting an agency and delegate the work to him, but I think that due to his extremely specific technical knowledge, it would be best if he started his own Upwork account.  Is it possible for two or more freelancers on this platform to join up under one and same agency?If not, what are the possibilities for such a cooperation?Do some people just start an agency alone and delegate the work to employees outside Upwork? What is in for them if they can just start an Upwork profile of their own?What are the benefits of teaming up as an Upwork agency? I am very new to this so all help is appreciated. Kind regards, Benoit

Profile is updated according to skills, knowledge and experience, in as much detail as possible. However, the profile was still not accepted.On top of that, it is very important for us to have his profile approved, since we have several existing upWork clients wanting to cooperate with him (i can also provide more details), but unable to do so due to his UpWork profile not being available for hiring.
 
Please note that frelancer is not able to contact with upWork support directly: create a post or issue or ticket to upWork until his profile been approved (for example ""New Topic"" button is disabled for him, there is not posibiity to write and email to chat on https://support.upwork.com/hc/en-us etc)
Could you, please, help us and approve his profile?

	Calendly alternatives and new Upwork TOS
","Jun 25, 2020  09:13:36 PM","
Hello there. We used to use Calendly on Upwork for easy and convenient calls scheduling with the clients. As you know, the field ""Email"" is obligatory to be filled in to set up calls using this tool.  As the new Upwork Terms Of Service entered into full force today, I went through different Calendly alternatives and it seems that all of those have the field ""Email"" obligatory and can not be edited or deleted. I tried around 10 of those and it was the same for each one of them.  I saw that Upwork is going to add such a possibility to the messaging system, while I didn't find any indication on the specific date of introducing this functionality to the platform. In light of this, I have several questions to Upwork and the Upwork community: 1) Are we allowed to share the Calendly link with the Email field since it is obligatory in this service and can not be removed from there (at least for now) until the very moment when Upwork introduces its scheduling solution? 2) If the answer to question 1 is ""no"" in any of its forms, what tools would you recommend as an alternative to Calendly that is allowed to be used for scheduling the calls? Thanks in advance,Daniel

This message is from my agency Team member **Edited for community guidelines**. Could you please read and resolve it.
I worked hard, delivered a product for testing on client server, But client start talking rudely like I am some one's slave. I refunded all billing money in a minute when I felt like working with this kind of person is like feeling disrespect. Even after refunding and installing all work to the client server, the client had written negative feedback.
Here are Contact details that I am talking about:**Edited for community guidelines**
But I had written an apology to the client even after this kind of humiliation just for retaining my profile rating. And he had given 5 starts then. But today UpWork has degraded my profile score. Why?
Is there no space for freelancers. For every dispute only a freelancer is responsible. Is it like that?
I am really feeling very much disappointed.
If I worked hard and refunded only because of the behaviour of the client. Even Upwork has degraded my rating.

I don't want to spend hours to check VAT numbers etc.- Why do I see a personal account in the chat while I hired that person as representative of a company ?During first chat to submit proposals I saw two profiles of the same person for that chat, one ""personal"" and one related to the company on Upwork.The proposal was made using the company related profile, which made sense, but he uses his personal profile for chatting. After talking a moment about that strange behaviour he was able to remove his professional chat profile, while I asked the exact opposite. In the end I feel the validity checking process quite broken on those points. Any help to do it right would be highly appreciated.

	Contact old clients

Hi, Hope you have a great week! I am a little bit confused about finding and contacting old clients on the list. Eg. I have a 500 contacts/clients on the list. The message box shows only 11 pages with 20 contacts on each page. So I clicked on to see all and it has displayed me a list of all the clients with pagination. Now I want to contact old client that is on the 20th page but there is not any quick way to message them. I have to click on that client and it will open a new message box in the same tab. Now if I want to message the second client then I have to follow this process again. It's too weird and annoying. Is there any way using that I can easily follow up with all the clients? Best,Prafull

My freelancer is taking forever to do the simplest tasks.

I'm a developer myself but inexperienced in Shopify, so maybe Shopify takes 5 times as long to move an element on a template page, but I don't think so. It's taking so long that now I'm wondering if there is a way they can cheat the system. I checked the pictures and they look legitimate becauase  they are screens of my work.  I'm wondering if she has a 2nd computer that she uses to just run the clock and refresh the screen every so often.

	NO CONFIDENTIALITY FEATURE FOR AGENCY OWNERS
","Jul 12, 2020  08:24:32 AM","
 I have an agency for  a while  and it was running smoothly until recently where I was forced to redirect my plans and business strategy due to this careless feature (I consider it as a design flaw). Upwork reveals the agent's rate and total earnings right after they leave exclusive agency .- I discovered this when I have to release my roster out . For example, inviting  agents as   exclusive  member  allows   you to have the agent's  rates and earnings to not display from the agent's  dashboard as both you and the agent pre agreed to a specified hourly.  This feature works  only when they are still in the agency.Now eveything is dandy until they start to leave or you remove them-rates and total earnings out in the open when it's supposed to be confidential information. In business, building trust with clients and your agents is top priority.   Such is not the case with the above situation. Upwork recognizes this design flaw and after 5 months of raising this ticket, they sent me a message saying they can't solve it as it is too complex to implement.   Request #27848284 Way to go Upwork!

	Some questions about agency
","Jul 7, 2020  08:14:52 AM","
Hi, so i looked through help files here but they seem to be kind of brief with the information.. I had some specific questions.For contracts with clients that are paid to agencies they do incur 20% for the first $500 i was wondering is this taken off the top or to each freelancer? For example funds are released is the 20% taken off then I distribute funds throughout the team? Another question I did not get much information from the help section, we have a few positions we need to fill how do we go about hiring freelancers to join the agency for a specific role... Usually client's post jobs but how do we go about finding freelancers without doing that are we able to contact them? I was just asking as I have not yet seen the agency platform yet.( For the above nevermind I seen another member had a similar question i will need to make a client profile to find freelancers) Also I did not understand the agency benefit of having just exclusive agency members? I know it can be beneficial to the freelancer if there is not enough agency work then can continue to get jobs from their own clients but what impact does this have on the agency (besides not as much time to contribute).

	Credit Card Limit Issue for Agencies
","Nov 15, 2019  07:37:01 PM","
My scenario:-I'm planning to start an agency here in UpWork. I have a credit card, however the credit limit is only $300 which is set by the bank.-My 5 team members will have a hourly rate of $4 full-time (40 hours a week) which is a total of $800 weekly. Now, the Question:If the total amount of billable hours of my team members ($800) is more than my credit card limit ($300), am I going to be suspended for billing method issue or insufficient fund issue? I asked my bank if they can increase my $300 credit limit but they said since I'm new card holder. They said I have to build my credit score to approve the increase on my credit card limit and that will take a long time and I already have a discussion with a possible client who is willing to work with us in UpWork under my agency. The client already needs to start the project as soon as possible but I have to make sure that I won't face any problem with having insufficient funds as we go along. Please advise

	We have a strange problem
","May 26, 2020  02:36:37 PM","
Hello there,
 
We have a strange problem.
 
In Upwork, our agency's founder (user id: **Edited for community guidelines**) has a freelance pro account and works on Upwork. He also opened an Agency account called **Edited for community guidelines**(Agency Plus) in upwork. He added me as a team member.
 
She is currently unable to apply for a freelance account, but can apply with an agency account.
 
In addition, an e-mail was received saying that the upwork is not a member and its application is not accepted. But she is already an Upwork member and working. (Rising Talent)
 
She gets the following error for all the jobs he applies from his Freelance account.
 
""Sorry, we were unable to save your application. This job is private. Only freelancers invited by client can view this job.
 
""When she checks, the jobs she applies are not private.  There is no problem when we apply with the same agency account.

	Is upwork a genuine platform to do business  as it claim  ?
","Apr 18, 2020  06:35:39 AM","
I want to raise a serious issue with upwork and for the interest of the people who generate revenues here . As a service provider who has done 600 projects( with 93% succes rate ) here and generated millions of revenues in 12 years , I feel cheated because of the flaws in the service agreements of upwork. I want the investors and the share holders of this website to look into this issue before trying to grow this paltform Around a year back one of the customer  contacted here for a fixed price project . We agreed on a fixed price and deliver the first phase , customer was happy after seeing the results and paid 1500$ for the work delivered. work was approved and the payment released from escrow . As a well reputed agency who employs 200 people , we payed the contractor who worked on the project . We agreed on second phase customer funded escrow and we started next phase , this time customer started increasing his demands than we agreed and we stopped working with him and the escrow fund was given back to him . The customer then contacted his credit card company and asked for the refund of the funds which he paid to upwork for the work he got which he agreed and payed . For our surprise the credit card company approved it after one year and upwork refunded the money from us . Its a very alarming situation for all the people working here . The customer support never contacted the business owner and refunded the fund stating some complex terms of agreement that there is no security of payment for fixed price projects . As the freelancers and agencies we want an assurance from upwork that upwork will not take away funds from clients who contacts credit card agencies in future . Its a serious issue and it should be covered undered the terms of service that , if a customer agrees to release payment after reviewing work it wont be reversed . Consider a situation a customer customer pays 100 k for a fixed price project and after getting the work he contact his bank and reverse it . How can it be reasonable in a professional platform like upwork . I would expect a reply from the CEO of upwork to clarify on this issue . Thank you

	Bad Review during UpWork ID Verification Process
","Jun 8, 2020  06:04:34 AM","
Hi! My name is Tori, I run an agency called **Edited for Community Guidelines**I started an hourly contract with a client for an agency member called **Edited for Community Guidelines**. Unfortunately, as soon as we started the contract, Upwork started an ID Verification process on **Edited for Community Guidelines**account, not allowing her to enter her account and bill the hours of her work. **Edited for Community Guidelines**was unable to enter her account for about 48 hours, making the client close the contract before we even started working on it. This seriously affected my JSS and reputation as an agency, for something that was really out of my reach.Is there anyway upwork could revise the situation, and maybe delete/take out this last contract that affected my JSS so much?

	Client cashback complete fund directly from his Bank and Upwork Paid him without my knowledge. :(

Hello Upwork,
 
 My Name is Ashvani sharma. I am running a small Agency through Upwork which name is ""Jmbliss IT Solutions"".
 
Now I am sharing Issue. That is I completed a project with a new client of Upwork on Hourly basis. Project was successfully completed and client  give me 5 start rating and good feedback as well. I also received payment of that work.
This thing happen in January month 2020. and contract Id is 23529906. I completed this project on 18th January 2020 successfully and worked with Upwork tracker because this was Hourly base work.
Now in this Month when I was trying to withdraw my monthly earning from my Agency account than I was not able to withdraw my fund and I have seen an Error.
Then I checked notification than I found 2 notification first was on 30th Jan which was related to chargeback notification which I couldn't seen due to my email id access issue and last one notification was that I am not able to release fund while Upwork will not get total fund back which I earned from that client who give me work in January.
My question is while I completed his work properly so why He went to bank and get chargeback from Upwork and why Upwork paid him without know my point of view?
 If I couldn't seen previous notification So Upwork could display any message in to my profile page which I regularly check. But now I am in big trouble that is total fund was $983 of that project and I paid Upwork fee as well in this contract.
 But client get complete chargeback from Bank and Upwork paid as well, Now Upwork is charging complete amount from my balance.
 
So I am losing following
$983 + $983 + My Previous efforts of work + My this month efforts on work = $3932
 
Please help me. I am only requesting to relieve from deduction of $983 amount from my earning.
 
 I am attaching screenshots here please check. I have trust on upwork ,
 
Waiting for your kind revert.
 
Many Thanks.

	Contract with Upwork
","Nov 28, 2019  02:48:05 AM","
Hi all!I am getting paid on Upwork for a project and need to get a contract with Upwork to explain to my bank and tax service why the payment came not from the contract counterparty. In Russia currency control is strict when it comes to currency coming in or leaving the country without due documentation. How can I get a contract with Upwork as an intermediary or Escrow organisation to explain this?

New to Upwork.  I have a contract I've used to hire contractors BUT does Upwork have a contract with terms and conditions I might look at to possibly replace mine?  ALSO - I have all the software to manage the contractor and their activities (logging in, tracking time, and outcomes).  Is there reason/value Upwork would be needed in these interactions INCLUDING payments (I usually just pay through Venmo)?  THANKS!

Dear Friends,I am not new to upwork but I was very less active here from few years as because of my offine jobs. But now I am planning to work on upwork in a full fledged way. But I have few confusions about hourly rates and fixed price rates. Please let my know how hourly have been calculated. suppose as if I put 5 USD in hourly rate section so will the client pay me 50 USD for 10 hours of work ? Will he really monitor me through gazets ? Or as if I qouted 50 USD for ten hours  that means the value of given work is 10 hours which will be 50 USD then if I submitted the completed work next day that wouldnt harm me ?

If so, How? 2. If the job is granted to me after i applied through an agency, but i colaborated on the job with an agency member, and also we both get paid, so on whose profile is the review going to come on?

	Most of the clients prefer Independent contractors over agencies - Or is it just me?

Hi guys, I am fairly new to Upwork (joined in December 2019) and was able to score an on-going project which is still up and running. I recently started noticing this trend that most of the jobs posted clearly say ""No agencies"" or something like ""FreeLancers only, no teams"" Is it just me or has anyone else noticed it? When I started an agency I was of the opinion that agencies get more consideration and rep points as they more trustworthy, have someone available to talk to the client and address any issues they may be facing on a priority basis if not real-time and agencies always have SOPs in place not to mention a diverse talent pool to help one another, if and when required. Project managers are always available for daily/weekly standups.  Am I missing something critical here?  Regards,Ike

I signed in today to cancel, thinking it would give me prompts for different messages on canceling and refund of unused time, but it just canceled after clicking one message box.

Nothing works so far. Our attempts as follows:1) We followed all your documentation and made a 3200*320 image.2) We tried both PNG and JPG2000 formats (see attached).3) We read through various community posts - only saw more folks struggle. I did not see resolution.4) We even tried 3200*600 as suggested in some forums. Same low res image. (see attached).5) Every time we try - we only use Chrome browser, incognito-private mode. To make sure there is no cache/ cookie issues. Same result.6) We see that some of your own pages offer much higher resolutions. Attaching our images in JPG and PNG formats.

	In which country to incorporate an upwork agency?
","Apr 27, 2020  05:36:39 PM","
Hey folks.So I would like to create an agency on upwork and incorporate. I would need it to be able to work with upwork and Payoneer (I guess). I would need everything to be done remotely cause opening a bank account in person is not an option (for obvious reasons lol)Obviously I'd like lower taxes since competition is rather stiff here. I guess most of my income from clients in the US and EU I suppose (and not sure how offshore income rules work). Also, I've read that Upwork Escrow is a Delaware LLC -  does it matter? I'm a Russian national so I guess it limits my options somewhatAs I understand my options are HK, Singapore, Estonia and smth like Delaware LLC?

	New Agency - How to Test Run Contracts?

As I'm learning how to use this platform, I would like to do ""test run contracts"" to get the flow of how various contracts and jobs work before I officially launch. I want to do this by creating a dummy client account and hire myself under various contract agreements. I also want to create another dummy freelancer account for my agency to hire.  However, I'm afraid that these dummy contracts of myself will be recorded on my agency's work history to my detriment.  Is there any way I can test run both client and freelancer interactions with my agency without it appearing on my agency's work history? Much appreciated Jett

	Option of letting the Team / Member leave the Agency should be altered to.....
","Jul 11, 2016  01:39:25 AM","
Hi,We are an agency and do believe that currently a team member has an option on his/her dashboard to leave the agency which allows that member to work as an independent freelancer. This according to me is not justified as this is against some agencies company policy and breaches privacy norms.Each company / agency has its own policy and thus as per us I believe that for the companies who keep staff on full rolls and the staff work on salary basis as an Employee and not work as contractors, there should be a provision I believe to not allow Employees to leave the agency profile and work as independent freelancer on Upwork taking away companies work which they did under that company.As a solution to this issue here is how I suggest the Upwork system should work…..If you are creating a team member under agency profile then there should be 2 options 'Member as contractor' and 'Member as Employee'. If Contractor is selected and team member is created, then later at any time the contractor will have option on their account page to leave the agency by clicking on 'Leave from Team' option which will make his/her account independent like the way it works currently.But if 'Member as Employee' is selected then Team member will not have an option to leave the company / agency and will not have option of 'Leave from Team' on their account. I guess this is fair and is wise and not much of the change will be required to be done on existing system and will keep company privacy intact.Let me know if rest of the agencies supports this option? Waiting for your opinion friends..Thanks,Amit

Hi,
I recently requested help in removing some members from my agency but I am still unable to remove them completely. I initially had 6 members and after removing the two, the agency profile shows it has 6 members.
 
Although only 4 are visible as it should be, it indicates there are two other members and on clicking to view those two, it keeps loading indefinitely. My goal is to completely remove the two and have the profile also reflect the agency has myself and 4 other members. I have attached a few screenshots to show what I am talking about.

	Earnings and hours associated with agency
","Feb 8, 2018  10:16:42 AM","
Hi - More than a 8months now. No one guided me correctly on this issue from start. You can check numerous tickets on this issue. When an agency freelancer doesn't even earn and withdrawn the amount agency earned, how it is feasible to show those stats on freelancer's profile? I have been told there is no FIX for this. We can only request to close freelancer's profile when they leave the agency. This I have been told after 8months when freelancer already started working indepndently. All I am requesting to fulfill data integrity, this model doesn't make any sense that an agency got the project for the exclusive freelancer, they paid comissions, the manager handled the communication. Freelancer followed the directions for work, logged hours  and Agency paid them in cash on hand. Then after wards all the agency earnings/hours being showed to freelancer's profile too. Why? I am not sure if am wasting my time again by writing this but may be it will make sense to any one working in Upwork data management dept. Thank you!

I have a Wordpress + SEO agency. we offer those 2 services. We signed an hourly contract with a client that wants us to manage both their Wordpress and seo. I have several agency members that each specialize either on SEO or Wordpress. My question is:Can I start a second contract with the same client? My idea would be to separate the jobs. On 1 contract work with SEO with agency member A, and on the other contract work on Wordpress with agency member B.Is this possible? If so how can I do it? I saw the option of proposing a new contract, but I didn't know if this would replace my current contract, or if it would create a second one with the same client. Can you answer this?The other option I thought of was for the client to start a new job. I would bid on the job with agency member B, and therefor I would have 2 contracts with the same client. Is this possible?

He has gathered a series of professionals on Upwork to sell different services, but since my job is to make lead generation ( so provide customers for them, building lists of emails, talking with leads and providing customers) he proposed me to be hired by his future agency on Upwork in this way:The agency creates a job post on Upwork and invite me to apply, then I can be hired by the agency on Upwork and be paid by Upwork agency.I was concerned by the fact that this procedure can drive me and him to have our accounts disabled by the Upwork's policies since I don't think it is a proper use of the platform.However, I'm here to ask the Upwork community: if you join an agency and you're hired through a job post by that agency and get paid by the agency that hired you, is that against Upwork's policies?Best regardsLuca

I checked my emails, I got email about ading the account is today at 3.31 AM. I am not sure how it can be activated immedeatly.

Hi UpWork team,
I hope you guys are safe from COVID-19 
I have an important concern to share with UpWork community, we get awarded on few hourly contracts from our new UpWork clients and we worked for a few days or working hours like 10 ~ 15 but as the whole world knows about the Corona crisis so our clients are not available for the active communication or they just want to put their running project and hourly contract on hold/paused due to severe conditions in their countries.
So, here I just want to make sure, in such cases of on-hold/paused contracts due to Coronavirus safety from our clients' then it will affect (low-down) our Agency or concerned freelancer profile JSS ?
I am looking forward to your reply and stay home, stay safe with your family 
Thanks,Vikash Sharma

That makes my team feel annoyed and extremely unbalanced between life & work.I would be very grateful to anyone with any suggested solutions.Thank you very much in advance!

	Problem with agency withdrawal?
","Mar 18, 2020  08:18:58 AM","
Hi, I initiated two withdrawls to bank account on Feb 26, one from mine and the other from the Agency account, the one from mine got transferred to bank in a day or two, the one that I transferred from the Agency account never came in to our bank account, so I opened a ticket and after 8 days Upwork initiated a trace. The support staff has been awesome and very helpful. It may take 2 to 4 weeks for to get to the bottom of this the support staff mentioned. Today again I initiated withdrawl, one from my account and the other from the Agency account. I got the usual mail that the transfer has been processed for withdrawl that I initiated from my personal account, and even the money was there in the bank account in 2 hours. whoa! It usually took 2 to 4 days earlier. But the transfer that I initiated from the agency account, I haven't yet got the mail that it has been processed and the money is not there in the bank account yet. I know that, its early, but I'm a bit worried and can't help thinking that it going to be like the last one. Anyone facing the same issue here recently? Thanks so much, Amitabh

My Agency's profile - https://www.upwork.com/ag/10xers/
 
A client recently made me an offer on my personal profile ( I think it's on personal as it doesn't show in my agency account and I am not sure as I am new to agency account )
 
However, I want this job to be accounted for in my agency account. It's good if it's accounted at both places, though if not I don't care if it is accounted in a personal profile or not.
 
I asked the client to change it and he sent me screenshots of the options he is seeingWhen he clicks on modify offer it shows this
 
 
and when he tries to invite my agency directly from my agency's page he sees errors and can't invite me
 
**Edited for community guidelines**
 
and we both can't understand how to go about changing this job proposal from my personal profile to my agency
 
Help requested1. Clarification - If I am currently in a non-exclusive state in my agency (didn't know I had to turn that on ) will my earnings still be shown under my agency ?2.

Right after this, the agency member withdrawn the application submitted under agency and submitted as freelancer and client hired him out of agency. I am EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED on this.1. the proposal was submitted as agency member2. The initial conversation was under agency message room3. They exchanged their skype on the agency message room, it means there were no old client-freelancer relationship4. Freelancer withdraw proposal as agency member and submitted as an individual freelancer after their communication5. Client hired him as a freelancer not under my agencyWhat action Upwork can take against client or freelancer now??Or upwork should bound both to work under my agencyIt is a TOTAL loss to my agency, I am investing in the training of freelancers, i am investing to buy hundreds of connects for agency members, and when a job is coming they are going DIRECT out of agency????This is not acceptable, not ethical, take some serious action on it.Why upwork don't develop a method as we can have control over agency members like it was on Elance? Its been years the agencies from Elance are complaining again and again and there is no action from upwork? today, I am REAL REAL disappointed, were not disappointed before in my whole career on upwork.

	Real-world company with employees finding clients on Upwork?
","Feb 20, 2020  08:00:56 AM","
I've been working successfully as a freelancer for the past 2 years and I intended to keep it up. However, I'd love to use my knowledge to create an actual, real-world company that hires employees for in-office work.Of course, I'd love to continue finding clients with Upwork for this company because I love the platform and this would surely drastically increase the profits of both me and Upwork.For the time being, I'd act as a sole manager of this agency/company on Upwork, finding clients and everything else required. The employees of the company would be full-time real-world employees, receiving regular salaries - not freelancers in any capacity.With this in mind, employees would have no connection to Upwork at all and all of the work, quality, deadlines, etc. would be managed by me as the manager and founder.This makes the most sense, as in the real world a client chooses the company - not the individual employee of it.As agencies on Upwork are focused mainly on groups of freelancers working together (which is not the case here), I was wondering if something like this would even be possible?In the unfortunate event that it is not, what would be the best alternative to this?Looking forward to your reply!Thank you very much,Branko

	Getting paid for earlier contracts before joining an agency
","Feb 16, 2020  10:17:19 AM","
Hi! I just joined an agency but I still have 'balance' from one of my previous contracts. However, now I do not see the 'Get Paid' option in User Settings, so I am not able to figure out how to withdraw those previous funds which are not associated with the work I'm doing with the agency? I've added the screenshot of how my User Settings look now, there used to be a Get Paid option here. I understand that the payments from now will be directly through the Agency owner, but don't know what to do about the previous payments. Any help would be appreciated, thank you!

	All agency workers must have own accounts, but is it actually true?
","Feb 15, 2020  05:36:57 AM","
Greetings! After I saw an agency profile on Upwork (which work in my city and has more than 150 workers/members in their offices in different cities), I got some question. This is their profile link - **Edited for Community Guidelines** and it has only 4 members (1 business manager and other is agency members), each has thousands of working hours for different projects with different rates (by working as the agency on Upwork projects) but this is CEO profile and he is not doing any job for themself, all work is getting done by their employee. How they can track the working time of employees? Can they just give access to their accounts and do that? Also, the agency has multiple jobs at the same time, how can it be possible without different accounts for each worker? 
 
With best regards, Eugene!

I've got a potential new client who wants to spend $5000 a month on advertising. He also wants a website and SEO. He just wants to pay me to do it all and manage it. Problem is Upwork is going to slice off 10% and then 5% commission on adspend which is not work hours. So he is going to be losing $500 and then $250 of ad spend a month. I can't see how this is reasonable. How can I do this in Upwork without breaking any rules?

	Payment methods under Agency Admin's Name instead of Agency Owner?
","Feb 5, 2020  07:33:00 PM","
Hello,I’m looking to create an Agency account and invite my business partner to join the agency as an Admin. I have a few question regarding Agency payment methods: Does the Agency payment methods have to be under the owner’s name (i.e. my bank account) only? Is it possible set-up Agency payment under my partner’s bank account name instead (he will be invited as an admin and manage all the finances)?Also, is it possible to get paid as a company (instead of a collective group of freelancers), which might make it easier for tax purpose?I found that the only option to create agency is to pay $20 for the Agency Plus plan. If there are months we don’t do freelance and temporarily downgrade to basic membership, will all the benefits and perks roll over when I reactivate the Plus plan?Thank you.

	Hourly Billing Problem in Agency Accounts
","Jan 16, 2020  09:31:59 PM","
I am stuck in a problem; I am getting hourly contracts on which I want to assign different freelancers who I have hired in my agency. My client doesn't need to know this because I negotiate only the TOTAL number of Hours put in by all of my employee/ agency freelancers combined; For Example, 3 of my employees will put in 100 hours combined per week, so I'll tell my client to keep the weekly limit at 100 hours and then I'll distribute the hours individually amongst all employees by assigning them individual weekly limits. But this does not seem to be possible at all. I have clear communication with my clients about deliverables and total number of hours. Why isn't it possible to assign to my agency freelancers without asking my clients to hire those freelancers as its a lot of admin work for them on Upwork Platform. Afterall, they see the agency profile and the Freelancers/ Employees I have at my agency page, why do they specifically need to hire the specific agency person as well? I might be taking work from 10 freelancers or just 2 freelancers; Once I have negotiated an hourly rate, upwork should total the hours all of my freelancers/ agency employees put in, bill the client at my rate and allow me to pay to my workers at out internally finalized rate.

It was either job location or job success rate.  I find this strange because if Upwork doesn't allow this , it shouldn't allow people to send proposals on such projects.

	How to rate an applicant, who stole me three weeks of time
","Nov 26, 2019  09:54:25 AM","
An applicant got the project description, asked some questions and called the price. I agreed. Along three next weeks the applicant tried to convince me, that he will not create a parts of my project, with explainations like ""i don't really need this"" or ""it wasn't on the tasks list, where we were creating the price"" or ""nobody needs this"". Than, after i insisted that every part of the project must be done as agreed, all parts of the project were on the tasks list and the applicant affirmed the price, he notified me that ""my project stopped being financially interesting"" and capped communication.Three weeks are lost. Is it a usual case there? Is it correct, that there is no possibility to rate such behavior?

1. Does upwork have any additional fees on Agencies besides the Membership Fee of $20?  2. If client paid an agency, will the agency get the full amount?  3. do you still charge the AGENCY a 20% after earning $500, then 10% after earning $10K?  4. do you also charge fees to my freelancers's earning when they were hired under my agency?

	What should be done when a client is asking for the refund of 1.5 years hourly contract?
","Nov 24, 2019  10:59:45 PM","
			
				
					
					
						Hello, We have been working with a client for more than 1.5 years on hourly job and have already billed more than 1200 hours. His Project managers were working with us and giving daily feedback as well asking for the updates. We have released the project 2 months back and did no billing afterwards, there were small bugs which client has asked us and we did that without any cost. Now I got a shocking surprise that client wants the refund of all the hours which we have worked till now because the product which we have developed is not good. My question is, what should be done here. This is very stressful and if client has already appointed project manager and were checking our work on weekly basis and releasing the payment, how come they can ask after 1.5 years of development. is it fair? we are one of the top rated agencies on Upwork but these kind of problems are giving lot of stress and business is suffering. Any suggestions here will be helpful. Thank You, Sunil

Can I ask them for their usernames within the UpWork Message center? Is that allowed? UpWork has limited information regarding this. Could you pls clarify this. As far as I know we are not allowed to ask freelancers with their email. Does the same policy applies to asking a freelancer with their User Name? ANSWER: You can only invite freelancers on your agency if you know them and know their username or email.

	Send proposal as an agency on behalf of other exclusive freelancer
","Nov 18, 2019  07:34:25 PM","
Hi,
 
I've just switched from individual to agency recently and now I want to move my contract over to one of the freelancer in my agency. So I closed the contract and I tried to access the job post as agency account. Now when I access this job post, it says I can send new proposal on behalf of other freelancers. (this screenshot is from my freelance account)
 
**edited for Community Guidelines**
 
But when I switch to my agency account, I still can't find the way to submit another proposal as other team member except myself. This is the screenshot from my agency account.
 
**edited for Community Guidelines**
 
I tried to send the job link directly to my exclusive freelancer but it says the job is not available anymore.
Any advice how I can submit a proposal on behalf of one of my freelancer?
 
Thank you and have a good day!

	Adding to agency the freelancer with suspended profile
","Nov 20, 2019  12:54:05 AM","
Greetings, community!I have a problem, and I hope to solve it with your help. I read similar cases, and did not find a definite answer, so I decided to create my own request. I am the owner of game developing and video production agency. For effective work, I need to add to my team my close friend, photographer and cameraman. Here is a link to her profile **Edited for Community Guidelines**
Some time ago, she registered at the platform, went through authentication and had worked a little  - she made one order as a private person (freelancer), and after that she was inactive for a long time. Apparently, because of this, her profile was blocked. She tried to contact technical support, but to no avail.
Since we are doing a video production department in our agency just now, and since this is a high-class professional who has photo exhibitions in Europe and a lot of merits in current specialisation (I can additionally provide the proofs, if necessary), with whom I made many projects before registering on Upwork, I want this particular person to join my team. I can vouch for it and give my confidence in the uniqueness and necessity of this artist for my team. Tell me, is there a way that does not violate the rules of Upwork that I respect, add her to my team?Thanks in advance for any response.Yours faithfully,Sergey

	Etiquette for Leaving an Agency
","Nov 16, 2019  02:43:29 PM","
			
				
					
					
						Hi there,I’m curious about the etiquette for leaving agencies. I joined one about two weeks ago, have yet to do any work, and the people running the agency are incredibly slow at responding to questions when potential work comes up. I’m feeling a bit frustrated with it, and while it’s only been a short amount of time with them, I feel like it’s sensible to expect replies within a decent amount of time if you’re trying to give me work.If I want to leave, should I send a message and wait? Or just send a message offering my apologies and leave? I’ve already been waiting for about 4 days for a previous question to be answered.I’m sure it will affect my rating, but I just don’t like that I have to wait so long for such simple answers about a job.Thanks!

	Agency Hiring for Fixed Price

A friend and I have an agency and I think we are close to getting our first client on a fixed price project.  We are both going to work on it and I find the Agency model on Upwork confusing. In order for both of us to have this work show up on our profile we both have to be hired on by the project and each get our own fixed price milestones, is that correct? In case that is not clear, let me give an example, let's say the work is for $1000.  The client would have to fund two milestones, one for each of us for $500.00.  Is that how it works?

Hello,One of the developers in my agency created a profile 2 months ago. As agency manager, I helped him complete the profile to 100% and get the Rising Talent badge. Then he sent passport and ID documents, they were accepted. Passed video verification call and got an email that it was successful.His profile was not allowed on Upwork though, we were still waiting for an invitation, but that's not the point.This week he couldn't log in to Upwork profile and got the error message. Then he contacted Upwork support on Facebook about that and got the reply:""We're sorry to confirm that your account is permanently suspended. We can see it has been decided that our working relationship must come to an end, and we regret that this has to happen""That was unexpected for sure. I didn't submit proposals for him yet and profile was not used much and now it's suspended.For what reason? Did he violate Upwork ToS somehow? I understand that profile might not be accepted, but freelancer can always change some details and resubmit - why blocking the account completely?Please advise what we should do in that situation?Regards,Mikhail
