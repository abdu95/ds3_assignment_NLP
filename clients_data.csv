	Freelancer outsourced the job to someone else? (to a non english speaker, work terrible) money lost?
","May 7, 2021  11:58:14 PM","
Hi. I am having a lot of issues at the moment with some work that recently got 'completed'. I am in disbelief at how this has been handled so far. I paid an individual freelancer $400 to complete a webpage. I left instructions and videos on what was required. The work was 'completed' numerous times. But ridden with errors every time. It was taking me longer to find and correct the careless errors than it would've done to complete the work myself.It turns out the freelancer has outsourced the work to non-English speakers that had a hard time reading and implementing what was required.A month late we still don't have a finished product, and the freelancer outsourced the work wasting time and energy.Now with the dispute... I have been told that I need to spend $300 for arbitration to have a 'chance' of getting my money back? Spending an additional $300 to get back the $400? This is absurd. The freelancer was a month late, outsourced the work, didn't complete the work and wants full payments plus I have to pay an additional $300 to challenge this? What is the best option here, I cannot believe this whole situation. Freelancer clearly violated TOS by outsourcing right? Plus the work is incomplete after me spending hours on revisions guidance etc. Would love to hear your thoughts.

	Freelancer performance claims and guarantees - TOS
","May 10, 2021  10:15:47 PM","
Wondering if anyone can point me to the section of the TOC the may deal with advertised performance guarnatees.  We have recently had a problem with a freelancer/agency who clearly advertising a performance guarantee or refund of paid fees. I confirmed this with the freelancer prior to starting the contract and have excalated to upwork support. Currently its an ongoing mediation process.  But I would have to assume that freelancer would be subject to certain terms of service with respect to what they advertise on their profiles and the claims they make to obtain contracts.  If not what would be the best course of action or recourse to deal with this specific situation.  bottom line freelancer made claims based on performance, and confirmed the refund policy in messages. Could not execute and provide the results and not is refusing to honor the guarnatee.  Very frusterating experience so far, i;m sure this is a one off. But either way i'd like to deal with this promptly.  Tahank you in advance for any advise that you can provde,

	Calling all MUSIC clients! (Some advice.)
","Jan 12, 2020  08:16:04 PM","
I'm just gonna be straightforward, and hopefully UpWork doesn't take this down. 
 
Some of us out here work in the music industry. We are basically on UpWork to fill in the ""gaps"" during certain seasons or to rack up a savings in a short time. Whatever the reason, we are HERE.
 
**edited for Community Guidelines**
 
Here's how you can help yourselves: 

Provide - in your job/task description - your artist name, band name, stage name (whatever the case may be...) so we can check you out. Don't worry - we'll make our way back here to UpWork for pay and parameters (TRUST me, because we want the protection too!). But, I can't tell you how many times I've submitted a proposal for an artist who later turned out to be not my niche genre. YES, that matters in terms of integrity and doing YOU justice. For instance, I only do pop, pop/hip-hop...and I dabble in pop/rap and a tiny bit of pop/EDM. YOU DON'T WANT ME REPPING YOUR COUNTRY BRAND, then...now do you? Ignore my credentials; trust me, you don't. Granted, there are things that are across the board regardless of genre, sure. But PLEASE for the love of your career, choose someone who lives and breathes that genre!
Choose someone with music industry credentials, not just the freelancer who will do the job for the least amount of money. Be willing to pay for quality and industry-specific knowledge, please! For instance, I come to you as someone:-with Artist Management experience-with Booking Agent experience (in MUSIC)-with Producer Placement experience (A&R, major labels)-working on my MBA in Music Business (SNHU/Berklee College of Music, '21)-who is an Official Member of The Recording Academy (the GRAMMYs)-with a strong (A+ list) network of connections I'm personally acquainted or friends withYeah, it's CLOUT. But still, please don't choose someone to represent you or your brand if they don't even know what half of that clout even *means....

This concludes my TED Talk. Thank you.

	What has happened to the Clients' account? No reporting tools? And what has happened to support?

I am a freelancer but also had a client's account. I haven't used my Client's account for the last 2 or 3 years. Recently, I wanted to hire some freelancers, so I switched to my client's account, created jobs and hired a few freelancers. But now I realise that all the essential reporting tools like reviewing the timesheets etc are not accessible anymore, unless I upgrade my account for $49/month. Also, there is no way to contact Upwork support. I can't find a contact form, or how to submit a new ticket, although I can find my old tickets - but there is no way to create a new one. So what's happening in Upwork recently?Isn't all the above restrictions an obstacle for clients? How can a client ""buy"" work or ""time"" from a freelancer, without knowing some details of the work and what he is about to pay at the end of the week?I, as a freelancer, am tracking time submitting timesheets... Do they have any value for my clients? *By the way: $49/month + freelancer pro account month fee + all fees on every transaction is a lot of money.

	Poor work quality, milestones not delivered
","May 9, 2021  10:59:13 AM","
Hello  I have been having a problem with the freelancer I am working withI was unforutnately unaware of the manual hours policy and feel ripped off.  The freelancer has input ALL their hours as manual and overcharged for the work.Additionally I the website is very slow, ranks very low in terms of website grading and is not optimized for mobile.There are many things that I was expecting the freelancer to be able to do such as integrating the payment gateway and now that we are knees deep into the project the freelancer said that they wont be able to do the task because ""they have never done this before""!. They have taken on alot of the deliverables that they dont seem to know how to do and I have been charged over $700 for a poor quality website when I was expecting to pay approximately half of that price. My main issue is that we are way past the deadline and have lost a significant amount of money doing so. I would like to launch the website ASAP but cannot because we arent able to finalize the website and its quality.I have attempted to communicate my concerns to the freelancer with no use.  I would like someone from upwork to review the hours with the quality of work and I cant seem to be able to get a hold of anybody; I have done a dispute and unfortunately its very difficult for me to communicate with the freelancer.

Hi, I used to be able to login to Upwork in Chrome with my google login, but now nothing happens when I hit the button for Google login. In the Upwork login screen, it doesn't say that popups are blocked. I also have popups allowed in Chrome Settings. I think this is an issue with the Upwork login screen, rather than just a Chrome issue, though I can login with Edge. Rather than spend more time on this issue, I would like to just get a direct password connected to my User rather than use Google. For that, I need to communicate with a live person. However, there does not appear to be any way to contact a live person with Upwork: as far as I can see, my only choices are the community forum and a chat bot.  Thanks,Tom

	Loose Money in Upwork
","Apr 7, 2021  12:24:07 AM","
I recently hired a fake or unprofessional freelancer. He was charging for doing something out of our work instruction. Eventhough if he did work according to our instruction, he ended up never giving the work nor proof of his works. I've been asking for his work evidence since 4 weeks which has passed by. On the other hand, Upwork has time limited of 4 weeks for dispute. In total, we lost money amounted charged $150 (on $4/hr rate). I can't imagine if he was charging at a much higher rate. So, I personally would want to pay higher to someone who has a unique skill/talent that I need as well as professional. But if he does not have any of that, why would a client pays these guys higher ? Why would a client pays a higher ammount on this platform to a replacedable freelancer where/whom you can pay to in a lower amount ? (asume SAME QUALITY!). p.sDo NOT correlate PRICE with QUALITY in this discussion !, because it is NOT correlated at all what so ever !  It's more about correlation in beetween of PRICE with UNIQUENESS !. So I hope upwork find more freelancers whom are tagged as unique to increase the platform's UX and income !

","May 6, 2021  03:34:46 PM","
All - I'm trying to get help regarding a freelancer that works for me and issues regarding his account.  However, I've spent almost 30 minutes trying to use the Upwork Help chat/support bot that tells me ""it shouldn't take too long"".   How can I actually reach someone to answer a question?  I don't even see where I can send a question/email to support. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I have not used Upwork in a few years and I'm trying to post a job but I receive the following error:  ""You don't currently have access to this page. If you have another account, switch to it and try again.""I am signed up as a Freelancer so maybe that is why? If that's the case, how do I change my profile to no longer be a freelancer? Any help on how to post a job would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

I had a contract with a freelancer and I had to cancel it after 20+ hours. The contract was dragging while 2 other freelancers hired for the same job finished their work.

There is one freelancer ""EXPERT"" that provides site speed solutions for a better SEO score.He deliberately inserts code that makes you think that he did everything right.At first look, it seems perfect and he easily charges 200$-400$ for few quick hours.For the long term, google WILL find the scam in the code and the clients of this freelancer will lose all of their SEO scores. Note- this freelancer uses bad code, and puts much effort to hide it. I was lucky to be spotted by a TRUE EXPERT to locate this scam! (it took him few hours) The worst thing is that I reported to upwork 2 days ago, and they did nothing (yet).this freelancer is still working and accepting 2-3 victims a week. Please help me to reach Upwork and stop this madness!

	Two-factor authentication for EU clients
","Apr 6, 2021  06:42:59 AM","
I have had a milestone declined today as MasterCard automatically declines all payments over 500 euro (roughly 590 dollars) from now on. Their response: Upwork as a platform does not comply with the EU directive called PSD2 which requires two-factor authentication to combat online fraud. Do any of you know if Upwork is going to comply with this in the future? To be fair, the milestone I had trouble with was approved once I split it up in two. But this is just a bit tiring and it's embarrasing not being able to pay freelancers on time.

	How to print an entire Upwork message thread
","Oct 27, 2015  07:15:07 AM","
As a client, I find the messages exchanged between myself and a hired freelancer something that should be preserved offline, either on paper, or as a PDF. The sometimes months of messages that are exchanged can be useful months or years later, if those messages contain details about the operation of a program that is being developed, for example. Things that may have been forgotten during the development can be reviewed if the project's message thread between the client and freelancer can be saved/printed/exported to the client's hard drive. Yet, despite what would seem to be an obvious need, I have failed to find any way to do just that. Simply using Firefox or Chrome's or IE's ""Print"" or ""Save As"" functions, you cannot get the ENTIRE message thread preserved offline. Why is this? Does it make sense to have no option of being able to refer back to an old project's communication/message thread other than by being connected to Upwork's Inbox?

I need either the email or phone number to the corporate office to file a complaint. I am in dispute with a freelancer that was hired to complete work that was agreed and signed by the freelancer prior to the start of the project. The freelancer has been paid and is now refusing to complete the work that was agreed to. I have spent approximately $10,000 or more with this agency as all part of this project only to find that the agency owner has backpeddled on many promises, late on all deliverables, not lived up to managing the project, and is now refusing to complete the development that was signed and agreed to. As a customer since this platform was o-desk, and having spent tens of thousands of dollars through this platform i will NOT accept anything short of total satisfaction including and up-to a refund from the freelancer along with the suspension of the freelancer. I have a legal team engaged should your company not be willing to participate in resolution. Please provide how i can formally escalate this issue.

						Hi there! Two years ago- I have tried to use my credit card for helping my friend to buy connects for bidding in projects. But as the card holder name was different than upwork name, the payment method add request was declined. But there was no message stating that the payment method has been suspended. So, yesterday i tried to add my card in my upwork client account for hiring a freelancer but this time- it's showing that ""Our records indicate that the payment method entered is already associated with maximum number of accounts. Please add a different payment method"". Although my card isn't associated with any single upwork account regardless freelancer/client/agency -then why the system is showing this type of error?

","Apr 30, 2021  02:27:02 AM","
I am a first-time employer, and recently hired a freelancer for a full-time job with the job title ""Need assistant for a monthly contract requiring stock trading/finance-related work"".In the job post, I said the job is assisting me in stock trading all day like tasks like research, tracking my portfolio all day long, sending me constant alerts related to my portfolio and market change, and grunt work related to trading.I also added a small point in the work description ""Any other personal assistance work.""Now I wonder where do I draw the line in personal assistance. I have many personal assistance tasks that I need frequently like ""Look who is a good doctor in my area for X health issue and book an appointment"", ""Call everyone and find who has this product available"", ""Look for best and cheap flight connection between these 2 countries"".Although part-time work, these tasks are completely unrelated to finance. I know a lot of white-collar workers don't like to do such thing and believe they are being treated like a servant.So my questions are:How do I know if my freelancer employee is okay with such work? I can try asking but I am not sure if he will say yes anyway since after all, I am his boss.

	Not able to delete ONLY client account
","Apr 25, 2018  02:07:06 PM","
I'm trying to delete only my client account. It has no members or active contracts.
 
The problem is that the link for account deletion in the Client settings section is the same for deleting the freelancer account.
A friend of mine who was new to Upwork accidentally created a client account for the first time. Then, he created a freelancer account and tried to delete the client account. What happened next is that all of his accounts were deleted.
 
The same is happening with me. The only difference is that I'm not able to delete my freelancer account because I have an open contract as freelancer.
 
Anyway, I'm not trying to delete my freelancer account, but the client account deletion link points to the wrong location.
 
As client
1. Select my client account in the upper right corner.
2. Go to Settings > My Info
3. Link for account deletion is https://www.upwork.com/UserSettings/profile/close-account
 
As freelancer
1. Select my freelancer account in the upper right corner.
2. Go to Settings > Contact Info
3. In the account info section, the link for closing account points to https://www.upwork.com/UserSettings/profile/close-account.
 
So, they're the same!! What's the correct link for deleting only my client account?

	How do I complain about a freelancer/agency and request money back

I want to make a complaint about a freelancer/agency **Edited for Community Guidelines** who repeatedly sent an app with so many bugs I wasn't able to determine that the functionality I had repeatedly explained was ignored and I'm not left with a phone app that doesn't work, is not fit for purpose and I'm out $2,900. He is a con artist and I want my money back.
 
I want to change my review to reflect the discovery of the fact that the app doesn't do as instructed.
 
I want to complain officially to upwork about this freelancer.
 
I want to get my money back. They quoted a few weeks, it has now been 9 months to complete it and I had to stop the contract before completion because upwork demanded another $600 be sent, which is a stupid system for when the money has not been sent because the app hasn't been completed.
 
Could anyone please advise how I might be able to do any/all of these?

	What's the point of mediation for hourly contract?
","Mar 29, 2021  11:07:37 AM","
I hired a freelancer to create an app and he promised to deliver in 100 hours. We started an hourly contract and throughout development he used various tactics to stall the development and get more hours (I'm not an app developer so his work logs didn't mean much to me). When he sent a broken app with multiple issues and broken functionality after 350 hours I filed a dispute only to learn that mediation can only help us ""reach agreement"" and that arbitration for hourly contracts is not available. 
 
Obviously we couldn't reach an agreement, that's why I filed a dispute in the first place. So the question is - what is the point of mediation for hourly contracts if it doesn't provide any remedy for broken agreements, stalling, and poor work overall? It only wasted time, as the mediation guy didn't respond for days and couldn't properly explain the process at any moment in private correspondence. But maybe that was because he didn't know much about it himself, as he initially said that arbitration is possible in our case before the freelancer corrected him (see attachment). 
 
I assumed that there would be more client protection for hourly contracts, considering it must bring more revenue to Upwork, while making the client more vulnerable with automatic payments. Now I see absolutely no sense in ever starting an hourly contract here.

Hi,I had hired a freelancer to work on a project, he said he had completed it succesfully and wanted the payment, he assured me it was a great project and he did everything as told, I was in work at this point so could not fully open what he had sent me so I truested him and sent the payment. After a few days I went back to the project to open, I see the whole project is a mess it is not what I had asked him to do and is a total nightmare I had messaged him nicely asked questions and no response whatsoever he is offline also and will not respond to me. I understand sometimes people take on things they can not complete but at least respond and explain sorry I could not do it 100% etc we are all people!! But I am very angry he has left me like this with no response and just took my money and I had given him a great review too.! this is very irresponsible and rude and I or anyone would not appreciate this. I have demanded a refund from him but still nothing, I'm not sure how to go about this now? how can I bring this further, no one needs more stress these days with everthing going on in our lives.

	Freelancer misrepresenting their skill level
","Apr 23, 2021  06:54:36 PM","
			
				
					
					
						I'm kind of in a pickle right now, and I'm not sure how to move forward.I'm a client and have been for over five years here on Upwork. I've had lots of successful projects and have always trusted Upwork.I recently went through a pretty rigorous hiring process for a project (a motion graphics explainer video.) I received nearly a hundred proposals, read through and examined them all, and whittled my way down to the person I decided on. Their portfolio was incredible and I was excited to work with them. We exchanged many messages, storyboards, mood boards, and examples, and the freelancer assured me they understood everything and would be able to deliver the entire video within 5 business days. Weeks went by, and he gave reasons why it wasn't done yet. I'm a freelance animator myself, so I totally get it, and wanted to be flexible, so I was.Then, today, he sent me a rough draft of the first animation slide (there are ~30 slides total,) and it wasn't even in the same universe, when it comes to quality, as his work that he shared in his ""portfolio"". Like I said, I'm a freelancer as well myself, and it was obvious this guy didn't create the work in his alleged portfolio. I was confused though, because his ratings were good, and he had an 80% job success rating for his past work – much of which was animated explainer videos.I confronted him about it and asked directly, and he said it would be fixed. He also admitted to having an illustrator and animator working under him, so I guess he's a mock agency or something? I totally get sub-contracting, I do it myself sometimes, and am fine with it, but I feel like he just pulled those videos in his portfolio from somewhere else to attract clients like me.The problem with all of this is the fact that we agreed to a project-rate with three milestones. We've already passed two of those and I've paid him half of the project's budget for just the storyboard he sent to me illustrating that he sort of understood the direction I wanted the video to head.But now, with the animations, they're wayyyy off, and appear to not be not done by the same animator, and I feel cheated.Am I just toast at this point? I mean, I feel like it's pretty dishonest to represent yourself as something and then not be able to deliver on what was agreed upon. Have any other clients out there dealt with something like this before? Do you have any advice for me? Should I try to reach out to Upwork? Is there any hope for me to receive a (even a partial) refund?

	Messaging Multiple Freelancers
","Oct 16, 2015  11:10:19 AM","
Right now, there doesn't appear to be any option to send a message to multiple freelancers at once. The only option that comes close is adding multiple freelancers to a 'Room.' But doing so would allow all people in the room to interact with one another - this is NOT something I'm looking for. I simply want a way to communicate a quick request to multiple freelancers at one time. Right now, in order to send a work request for content, I must individually look up every freelancer by name, enter the message in their private 'Room,' then go onto the next. It's unbelievably time consuming and tedious. There should be a way to add multiple freelancers into a group 'folder' or something of the like, to allow me to send a group message without having them all be able to have a group conversation. I want the conversations to remain one on one, as they are now. Just the option to send a message to multiple users at once.

	relationships with the client after fixed-price work done
","Apr 25, 2021  06:56:44 AM","
Hi.Am I correct that after a client paid me for a fixed-priced project It means he accepted the work and he could use the result of this work at his own risk and peril. Am I responsible as a freelancer for the bugs in the software which might appear in the future after the work was delivered? What should I do if the client will blame me for this? It looks like the client I am working with didn't check the result of the work well enough and he wrote me after around a week I got paid: ""We made a mistake with trusting you to provide us with correct and truthful information... I am not angry at you. I made some promises on when we would start to other people"" I made a typo when answering the client's question about work results and it might be prevented if the client checked the result of work.  One more thing. The client asks for endless fixes and asks too many questions. He misrepresented his skills in python. He couldn't even install packages and instead of using google tell me to fix this type of thing very insolently and impolitely. He tried to call me at midnight without making an arrangement.I've already done for them by far more than they paid for and wouldn't like to hurt my reputation with a bad review but would like to stop these frustrating relationships. Could you give me advice, please? Thank you!

	Beware clients: time tracker is over charging you... like crazy!
","Oct 27, 2015  08:15:58 AM","
Ok... so this is what happened. I just started my first hourly contract on Upwork (I just migrated here from Elance) so it was my first time using the tracker. Yesterday I could see that on the real time tracker (the top part) it showed 5 minutes but below (total time for the day) it already showed 20 minutes. And believe me, I was very aware I had started 5 minutes ago... Today I started working and I had been working for 29 minutes, when it already showed 40. So I contacted customer support. Their answer is that it charges in 10 minutes blocks, which would make sense... but there is a trick. If you start at 11:59... you would believe it will charge another 10 minutes at: 12:09... but it doesn't! It does not track 10 minutes blocks in real time. It takes 10 minutes blocks by the clock... but this I mean: If you start at 11:59 it already charges you 10 minutes for the block corresponding to 11:50 to 12 PM. And if you click Stop at 12:01 it charges you another 10 minutes for the block corresponding to 12:00 to 12:10... so you end up paying for 20 minutes instead of 3. Now imagine if that happens 3 times in a day, you are already paying 1 extra hour. Now what if some one does that (not necessarily on purpose) more than 3 times a day? Which is possible... After a long discussion, this is customer service's conclusion (literal): ""It shouldn't be a big different in the time."" For you!! Because you don't have to pay for it. Imagine what this means for freelancers with the highest hourly rates!! Also multipy this for every freelancer in the platform, working around the globe, 24/7.... it's a lot of money!!! that goes to automatic payment! Needless to say: I have never and I'll never over-charge a client, so I'll talk to him about not using the tracker... But this is crazy!!! I'm not sure whether to laugh or cry....

	Ripped Off, I paid for A website Redesign They deleted the job and took the money.

HI there, i just want to know what can i do in the case of these freelancer from agency that i hired for a job, the worst thing that i made is paying a web redesign based in hourly rate.anyways the case is that they were making a poor job, slowly process, they told me that it will took 40-45 hours trusting on these guys believing they were about to do an incredible job, WRONG.They took 12 hours for 8usd rate, they were doing just copy paste for the original page that i have, images they already had from the examples that they gave me to see how could be the page, when i requested something original based on these examples obviously, ripped off, i asked a refund , they say no , ok i opened a dispute, the dispute team gave them the case, Conclusion after all that they deleted the work, they dont even let the backup of images themes, just nothing and they took all my money.The dispute team just took in case that Per Upwork's user agreement the client, not Upwork, is responsible for managing and maintaining the quality of work. oh yeah what about that they deleted the work.I felt scammed in every way because at the first that i was negotiating about the redesign they insisted in the hourly rate just when i was saying that is better in fixed price, but i trusted on them, they know how the system works, BEWARE of this, anybody can do a scam with these because in fact they will win the case using the norms in their favor. Now i have another week billed that i have to dispute with this poor team from upwork too, ridiculous.I mean i like upwork, but they dont care, they dont see the facts. Any help to what to do in the next week bill that i have to pay to these scammers will be helpful.

	Plagiarism expiring after 30 days?
","Apr 24, 2021  03:52:50 AM","
Hi, So first off, I'd like to say I've been a very happy upwork customer for years. I've hired dozens of freelancers to write articles articles, and I learned to stay away from those who aren't good at writing content and aren't experts in their field. Until now. Native English speaker freelancer, experienced in her field - just what I needed. It was her first job, but we all have to start somewhere, right? The way she communicated was perfect. No red flags. She writes 11 articles, when I get the idea to use copyscape. Yes, I should ahve done it sooner. Most articles are ok, except for one that's 66% plagiarized, and another one that's 30%. Of course, in reality, the percentages are higher because she changed some of the wording. I was in shock. We already had a milestone in progress that was funded and she delivered work, and I was just about to approve it when thsi happened. The funny part? The 30% article she spun belonged another website of mine. And before you ask, yes, Wayback Machine took a spanshot  of the article after I published it last year, before the two of us met. The other article belongs to a high profile website in my niche. I can't imagine the damages to that website I would have had to pay if I had published the article. It's almost identical. Her reaction to all of this? Shrugging her shoulders. She can't understand what happened. She didn't copy paste. Maybe she reproduced the thing unconsciouscly afte reading the sources for inspiration. She is quite the prodigy. She never tried to figure out what happened. Just shrugged her shoulders saying ""it wasn't me"". Veery quiet about it, letting time pass by, while sometimes replying to my messages,  leading me to believe ther's progress and that we can work it out. Not surpising for someone who ""used to be a laywer"".I've been trying to work something out with her for 3 weeks now. She's very good at stalling, though she does reply, so she's not sick. I asked for refunds for the articles (a partial one for the partially plagiarized article) but she did not reply to them. She said she will have something ""asap"" but didn't. Last night I found a 3rd article with issues, and requested a small refund for. Thankfully only had one paragraph plagiarized. She offered it this morning ""as a gesture of goodwill"". A gesture of goodwill after she refuses to refund me an 8X larger amount of money for the other two articles, and after she's purposefully stalling for weeks. And the worst part? We still have a milestone for an article that passes copyscape that I have to pay. It's roughly the same amoune as what I am owed for the plagiarized content. And it seems I have to pay it.Upwork, what is happening? 30 days, really? Do crimes expire after 30 days? Yes, I should have done it sooner. But only 30 days to get a refund for a piece of content that is an obvious scam? As a client spending money here, that doesn't make me feel very safe. Please change your policies. I'm not coming back after 7 years (even though in front of the law I can), I'm coming back after a few months. Another fair optionfor UpWork would be to start suspending such accounts. The evidence is there. It doesn't matter whether you refund the money or not. These are not the kind of people you want on your platform. Thanks, Ovi

	UpWork invoices are not compliant for EU
","Apr 4, 2021  01:42:38 PM","
Hey everyone,I am a EU based client and I hired someone for a certain project. Project is proceeding quite well. Problem which I have is that my Finance department is not satisfied with invoices which we receive from UpWork. For hourly based work each week we receive 3 pdfs:- receipt, seems fine, it contains total amount for processing fee and actual work- invoice for payment processing fee (3%), which is okay (screenshot attached)- invoice for actual work and this one is not okay (screenshot attached)The ""from"" section is populated with personal data (name, surname, address) of a guy which I hired via UpWork. This it just wrong. This is an invalid invoice under our legislation and I can not submit it further. Invoice comes from UpWork and it is paid to UpWork meaning that ""from"" section should be populated with their data. Just the same way as it is in processing fee invoice.I bet I am not the only one with this problem. I am just wondering how you guys solved this?Thank you for any answer!Marko

Dear all, As we are new on Upwork we had recently hired a developer. But she didnt did anything on our website.

But as we had stop the project in the middle of week we were charged again for the other days. But this time the freelancer rejected our refund and we filed a dispute but the customer service went through her work diary and they only refunded us $8. We had an existing website. Instead of working on our website and the task we asked for the freelancer did the contrary and messed up our website completely. How do we ask Upwork for refund of the remaining.

	I requested a dispute from a freelancer as I was completely mislead.
","Apr 17, 2021  07:27:18 AM","
Hey everyone,  As per the subject line, I've officially experienced my first awful encounter with a freelancer. My job description was clearly trying to vet a designer to fulfill my click funnels landing page and essentially revamp what I currently had. The job posting was clear as day. The freelancer's profile intrigued me, so I got on a call with him. Now, no harm to anyone but this gentleman was from Moldova and had very broken English and he APPARENTLY pitched me a consulting for a whopping $1000 USD whereas I thought it would be the actual work. I got on the second call with him and asked him when the design process would actually begin and he said he would create the design, and only assist with how the design should be. The call consisted of him sharing his screen showing us different options on how to execute our landing page design, customer persona, etc. [Everything in the call was stuff I already knew, I needed execution]. Wholeheartedly, I really feel like I got scammed. I can't believe this is actually happening. This payment is as follows: April 6: Escrow of $10000April 12: First call (1 hr) - My team confused as the ""consulting"" was out of expectation and even then, he did a horrible job. April 16: Second call (20 min because we realized we were being scammed) April 16: Dispute It's a fixed job, not hourly. Note: The freelancer will only give me back $400 USD and I of course am requesting the full amount. Can Upwork enforce the full amount back to me without going to arbitration?

	Can't make payment
","Apr 20, 2020  01:02:05 PM","
My PayPal payment to a freelancer was rejected because my credit card, which is my primary payment method for PayPal, blocked the payment as suspicious. I have now marked the transaction as not suspicious, but I can't re-try paying in Upwork, because Upwork won't let me re-attempt through PayPal. Apparently you only get one chance? The only reason I'm paying through PayPal is because you won't accept my Revolut Business Mastercard, simply because it's a prepaid card? So I am stuck and would like to pay this freelancer, because she's doing great work and I value the relationship. Very frustrating, and after an hour of trying to make sense of your customer support system, I'm ready to pull my hair out. Please assist me in running my payment through PayPal a second time now that the payment is no longer marked as suspicious. Thank you.Bradford Goodwin

Hi,  I am a client located in India, and am working with freelancers based in India also. I am making payments through my credit card. However, the invoices that are generated by Upwork are in USD. Is it possible for me to get invoices in INR? TDS: As I understand, anyway I shall need to gross up and pay TDS (as upwork does not allow any deduction), but for that I shall need the Freelancers' PAN number. How can i get that in the invoice? GST:  GST is not added,a. if the invoice is in USD I shall need to pay GST directly to the govt (reverse charge mechanism), and then claim setoffb while if it is in INR, and from a non-registered freelancer, then no GST is added in Invoice Also, if the invoice is in INR then i suppose it will not be considered as a foreign remittance so i shall not need to file Form 15CA/CB? Anyone here having experience with this, do please suggest.Thanks very much,Vivek

	Fraud
","Apr 15, 2021  05:08:05 PM","
There is more than just academic fraud - there is straight up fraud!
I recently hired someone to create some content for an online course I am creating and specified I was looking for someone with native or fluent in English, they provided their proof of work which was a thesis in perfect English.
I hired them because they had a masters in Psychology and that is along the lines of the work I do.
I asked them to read 3 pages of a document and summarise it for kids to understand and I got half a page of bullet points with images so small they couldn't be read and emoji's (in a professional document) and it was completely off topic and all in broken English.
My 6 year old son could tell the sentances didn't make sense!!!!!!!
 
I was vchared 10 hourse to find and resize 10 images - when I agreed to 1 or 2 and to convert a word doc to a PDF.... 10 hours???
She also continued to bill me after I told her I didn't want her to continue as I was unhappy with the work and then agaon after I cancelled the contract.
I have been told that upwork can't decide to refund or not, it is at the complete discression on the hiree - why would someone conducting fraud refund money?
 
I was billed 35 hours in total = $525
Do you think that is a reasonable price to read 3 pages and summarise them into half a page????
I think not!
 
Upwork your operating processes and extremely questionable and unlawful!
I am under the impression that a company cannot willingly allow someone to conduct fraud within their business - regardless of the T&C's - the law trumps your T&C's.
 
Unfortunately it was only after I used your platform, that I found a number of fraudulent complaints about you online and most of these have gone unresolved.
 
You need to start taking these things seriously, what you are doing is illegal!

I think there should be dots of colors or icons next to Clients names when chatting with them, maybe gray for payment method not verified, yellow when a milestone hasn't been activated, or gray when they pause the contract. Or is there an easy method to see their status besides the connection?

	My freelancer is the worst ever.
","Apr 15, 2021  03:06:05 PM","
My freelance is is very rude! we talked through zoom yesterday and she gave me some advices regarding my resume that I didn't need (you can check that I already fixed it in Upwork before) after that she started guiding me on how can I answer the questions attached. I stopped her and told her that I don't need you to guide me since I know how to write it but I don't have time to do that's why I posted it her. She got very angry that I took from her time and that's what she understood from my post. Although my budget is only 20$ she said she can do it but I have to pay more and she won't cancel the contract since I already took from her time. I told her that I'm paying 30$ just for her to finish it since I already took from her time as she said. she told me that's ok and closed the meeting while I'm talking!!!!! Today morning she sent me a msg here that she won't do anything and will open a dispute if I didn't pay her work that I didn't benefit from at all

	Upwork team has allowed a Freelancer Fraud despite being given evidence
","Apr 3, 2021  10:44:23 AM","
Upwork website offers to connect customers with a “trusted independent provider”, to find “the right talent” for customers, to connect customers with “professionals”, saying that the talents provided are “reviewed” and are “trusted experts” as well as other promises that make customers feel that they are protected and that Upwork environment is safe. As a client, I relied on these presentations and commitments when I used their services and engaged one of their translators for a single translation work in August 2020. However, and to my great dismay, I discovered that I was fraudulently billed additional sums of money, accumulating to thousands of US$.I contacted Upwork and they in turn, rightfully requested the freelancer to provide proof of communication with me, or any other kind of proof that she has performed any kind of work whatsoever for me after August 22, 2020. Not surprisingly, the translator was not able to do so, falsely claiming that she was bound to some “terms of license” and could therefore not provide proof of the work she claims to have performed. No proof of existence of any such perported “terms of licence” was provided. Furthermore, I informed both her and Upwork that I am waiving any privilege I might have and am authorizing the translator to provide any writings, documents or communications that she claims to have had with me to Upwork. However, the translator was still unable to provide any shred of proof of the claimed work she had purportedly performed.  Please note, that the translator’s claim, as if she is bound by some “terms of license” that do not permit her to disclose communications with a client, and that, furthermore, those purported terms are not waivable, is false as well as absurd. First, no such terms exist in her profession and there is no “translator privilege”. Second, even the highly protected communications between an attorney and his or her client are easily discoverable once a client waives his privilege.  The translator’s claim that she cannot provide you proof of the work she claims to have performed due to some “terms of license” is clearly a feeble excuse. It is as clear as can be that the translator did not perform any kind of work for me after the single August 22, 2020 task. By using Upwork services and the platform they offer she was able to defraud me of thousands of US$.In light of Upwork commitment to their clients, to the fact that they have negligently listed a fraud on their website - a website which promises secure transactions to its clients, that they negligently dealt with the billing inquiry I had made back in October 2020 about this, I still continued to be fraudulently charged on a monthly basis. My requests that Upwork provide me with the full personal details of the translator, including proof that she is indeed a certified translator, so that I may take appropriate steps against her were ignored and the case was closed leaving me short of thousands of US$. Should anyone want to know more details you are welcome to contact me.Thank you Upwork for your ""proffesional service"".

	Double Billing from Upwork
","Apr 15, 2021  02:04:30 PM","
Hi,Has anyone ever noticed that they were charged twice on their credit card statement for a single invoice? I can't find anywhere in Upwork where I can make a dispute on this. My freelancer (hourly) was paid once on this single invoice, but I have a credit card statment with the same charge twpo weeks apart. No other payment has been doubled, and all the other weekly invoices line up with the credit card statement. How do I fight this and get a refund? Please and thanks for any advice on how to find a human to support. The Upwork bot can't seem to understand my concern, and filing a dispute wont work since the freelancer was paid correctly.

	How to file formal complaint against Freelancer once contract has ended?
","Apr 13, 2021  11:44:19 AM","
To Whom it May concern,  I ran into this issue on Upwork once before but unfortunately fell victim to it this time around. I contracted a 3D designer via the Upwork network based upon his rating. We contracted for a 3D product design on Upwork and he completed it on time. The next day, he suggested I have him build the prototype on his company contract off Upwork as it would save him fees and he could save me money. I knew this wasn't proper however, based upon the discount he gave, I agreed. I gave him 50% upfront and he spent 2 weeks building the prototype and sent me an invoice for the remainig 50% prior to shipping. I told him I'd send the remainder once I inspected the prototype. He said this was not the industry custom and I should send the remainder first. I refused and eventually he sent the prototype. To my disappointment my suspicion was correct...not only did the not prototype work (which means the 3D files he created via Upwork are useless), he attmepted to glue the 3D printed model back together in places where it had broken. He knew the prototype was defective weeks ago which means he knew his 3D/CAD design was faulty. Instead of saying this to me, he attempted to defraud me on the contract hoping I'd pay everything and then he would have the money free and clear. I tried texting him and asked for him to either re-do the design/prototype for free or refund the money in full. He has since blocked me from Upwork messages. But he left me a Client Review on Upwork that read, ""Great Client!"". LOL...great sucker more like it.I know Upwork won't be able to get my money back and I intend to let small claims/civil court do that. My question is: how can I file a formal complaint against this freelancer so that he is blacklisted from this site and isn't able to take advantage of another client here? (And he won't be able to use Upwork as his platform to go fishing for clients avoiding their fee service) Thank You. - (Pics of Cheap 3D prototype with glued broken pieces attached)3 glued pieces. One broke offBroken pieces of prototype. Cheap materials. Freelancer wanted $2544 total for this.

	Mislead by ""Architect"" am I protected?
","Apr 14, 2021  12:56:24 PM","
Hi everyone, I am new to UpWork and getting increasingly frustrated. I recently signed up to hire an architect and engineer on here to do drawings and MEP work for a new restaurant buildout of mine for a new construction lease I signed. I want to be as up front as possible, this is an all new startup and I have no experience with going into business so unfortunately a lot is trial and error so far. I was up front about my ignorance and naivity to both the Engineer and Architect, I even arranged a conference call with them before offering a contract so I could just make sure what details were needed for my buildout was understood and I wasn't missing anything that I need for a FL commercial space. This architect who shows a Masters in Architecture on their profile, as well as many open contracts and assured me he has experience in FL for commercial AND specifically restaurants but could not send those works due to non-disclosure. Again, my naivity if that is not an industry standard. Anyways, I paid half of the job already when he produced the first couple drawings but had many errors and typos that needed correcting which furthered this process. He did tell my engineer in the beginning that he was not FL licensed and was awaiting it, but was working under a licensed architect and lead us on to believe that architect would seal the plans, over a month later and his ""complete"" plans are useless since he can't seal them. I do NOT wish to pay him the remainder and I feel extremely mislead given how honest I was about my ignorance to the overall process. Being unfamiliar with this platform, I trusted UpWork freelancers were vetted to some degree or verified, but it appears thats not the case. Makes me terrified to ever use a freelance platform again. Does UpWork protect any of its clients with this or is it a free for all on here with the honor system?

After an awful 9 months working with a Freelancer, we in turn left a fairly bad review 2.2/5 - it was honest, factually and fair.

He is not asking for anything, this is simply revenge. I have full records and screenshots of this. Now, I'm aware of review systems and I will of course reach out to them with the edvidence (if/when) this happens.  However, my question to the community is, are these types of threats and actions against UpWork policy and should they lead to account's being suspended? NOTE: I've already reached out to UpWork Support directly regarding this matter with the edvidence, I just wanted to get the communities thoughts as to how best handle?

	About freelancers and removing feedback
","Apr 28, 2020  06:30:42 AM","
It is a little weird, because I working as a freelancer too, and know some problems on the other side.  Short- I had a contract, I send a bug, freelancer was on some trip 3 weeks, I tell him, no problem when you back please fix the bug. After 3 weeks he not answer and tell me that he is busy. I close the contract, and he removed my feedback. But his feedback stays, and my response to this feedback is not live. There are several levels of a bad situation. 1. If a freelancer has the power to remove feedback, why his feedback stays, it is not transparency, and legal, if he removes feedback, it is logical to all feedback be to remove not just from client. Now only his response is live, it is not right. 2. Why at least my response on his feedback is removed too? Now on my profile is only one feedback and only from a freelancer  ?

He changed a line, and instead of a period for an action tag, he used commas, which is not correct.

Hi guys,  So I recently applied for a long-term contract and after some initial negotiation, I had a video-call interview, submitted a sample, and was offered the job - but via email, with no official contract. I asked for the contract to be formalized but was assured that it would be done so at some point further down the line.  I contacted the client about two weeks before the job was due to start and was told that everything was proceeding and that the job was due to start on time. So I waited. On the day the contract was supposed to start I got an email from them saying the project start had been delayed, but not by how long, so I replied and asked for a timeframe on this. No response. I emailed them again six days after the contract start date asking again for clarification and again got no response.  This has been disastrous for me. The contract was for full-time work so I did not pursue any other opportunities and now have no money coming in. Call me naive for trusting them but I decided to go with it and see the good in people, plus there's a cultural difference.  Any ideas? At the least, I do not think that this client should be allowed to use Upwork.  Thank you.

						I have multiple open-ended hourly contracts for freelancers who provide online customer support.

As far as I can see (and forgive me if I’m just blind but I checked the help docs thoroughly for mention of this capability with no luck) there is no way to see this data except for a single 10-minute time block in the Work Diary.If this does exist, where can I find it?And if it doesn’t... please Upwork, consider adding this ability to the Work Diary, it would be hugely helpful for clients with many ongoing hourly contracts.

	Redistribute Funds from Miletone
","Apr 9, 2021  12:08:27 PM","
Hello,When the project started, Upwork deposied all the escrow funds into a single milestone which is precisely what I didn't want to do. I wasn't aware that I couldn't redistribute those funds, so now it seems the only alternative is to cancel the contract and make a new one with properly funded milestones.I wouldn't want the freelancer's profile to be affected. Is there an easier way to alleviate the issue?

	Hiring freelancer for a test project
","Apr 7, 2021  07:53:12 AM","
Hello there,I'm new to Upwork and this is my first time hiring freelancers for my writing project. I set up a job posting for a fixed rate project for a 7 book series (that would pay a fixed rate for the completion of all the books). However, I found a freelancer that I has agreed to do a trial run by only writing the 1st book in the series to see if his work meets my expectations. I'm not sure if I need to set up a new job for this since it will be a different fixed rate than the whole series, OR if I just need to set up the first book as the only milestone for the project with the appropriate fixed pay for that book?  The second way would be easier, but if I end up using not using this same freelancer for the rest of the project, would I just end the contract after paying him for the first milestone (completion of first book)? Thank you for your help with this!

	What to do when your freelancers account gets suspended mid project?
","Apr 7, 2021  06:04:47 AM","
Just about ready to bail on Upwork. In the middle of a project they suspended the account of the person I was working with. I hadn't been billed yet, but they had already begun to send me files, so now I'm not sure what to do. I'd rather wait and see if they can get the issue resolved because I don't want to start the project all over again. Upwork gives no insight into why the account was suspeneded, so I have no idea if this is going to be a permenant suspension. There's also seemingly no way to contact or talk to anyone at Upwork about this issue to get clarification. This lack of transparency is not acceptable. It's like Upwork ghosted me in the middle of a project.Does anyone have any experience with this?

	Upwork is overcharging clients
","Apr 8, 2021  09:59:28 AM","
I am very disappointed with the UpWork platform.  I have two freelancers, and just last week I noticed that I was overcharged by Upwork almost 2hours additional than what the freelancer (hourly) logged.  Just liked the Work Diaries capture screenshots on a 10-minute interval, the client is charged for that. For example, if the freelancer starts work at 8:37 AM and ends the segment at 8:47 AM, you would think that that you would be charged for 10 minutes of work. That is actually not the fact at UpWork. Because the freelancer started the work on 8:30 to 8:39 interval, you are charged the full 10 minutes.  This would not be a problem if it's a 1-time thing, but when you add them up, in 1 week you can be overcharged heftily, let alone a longer period of time.  I have spoken to the support and was told that I need to dispute that time every week, which makes it really challenging and time-consuming (not to talk about straining the relationship between the freelancer and I).  Do any of you know if this has been brought up to the development team, or anyone else?

	Freelancer is not showing me any work after 5 months
","Apr 7, 2021  11:25:08 AM","
Hello,I am under the impression that I have been scammed a large amount of money to develop an app. It has been 5 months since I hired freelancer in November and I have not received any work that reflects what I paid him to do. Every time I ask for updates on progress he runs around in circles and blames me for every delay he could possibly come up with. He has been extremely unprofessional throughout the whole ordeal and regret letting it drag out this long with hopes that he will do the work. He keeps pushing the date back on when I could see any work and to this day I literally do not see any app. He says he has 80% of it done but did not reply the last time I asked for a meeting to see his progress. I need help either getting the code he says he has done so I can end the contract or help me get a refund for some of the amount I paid. I believe he is a scammer and should NOT be on this platform anymore.

	Negative Feedback as a Result of a Dispute
","Nov 19, 2016  07:46:55 AM","
I disputed a contract and won the dispute. The reason why I won was because the freelancer made claims the lack of requirements were the reason for their lack of progress, which I proved was not true. The agency freelancers used the same claims in my feedback, and it has resulted in my feedback score being very poor.  I want their feedback removed. I've been told to contact them and mediate the feedback, but they will not respond as they are very upset about losing the dispute. Upwork's dispute process is what I followed, and it resulted in a bad feedback score for me. I shouldn't be penalized for using Upwork's dispute process. I have tired to hire several freelancers since my rating went from five stars to 2.3, and now nobody will accept my work.  I've spent well over $100,000 on Upwork, and it not appears I'm going to be forced to change providers due to a dispute process that Upwork initiated, managed, and resolved.  I just can't believe that they would allow either party to post feedback after a dispute has been filed.  Unbelivable. I've tried to contact the freelancers, but both refuse to change their feedback as they are mad because they lost the dispute. Thoughts for how I can resolve it?

	Approved Last Milestone, but still no project delivery by developer
","Apr 5, 2021  12:26:49 PM","
Hello all,  In December 2020 I started a direct contract with a developer for my (mobile) website project. And the developer and I used the payment escrow system from Upwork, because it seemed safe for both parties. He would be sure that I would pay. And I would be sure that he would deliver the project. The project was estimated to be around 4000 dollars and to be paid in 6 Milestones. Maybe if it was more work, we would add a Milestone. Communication with this developer was great in the beginning, many calls and he replied to all my questions and had great ideas. Sending me also screenshots and videos of the project, so I wouldn't have to worry about anything. And also, I approved the Milestones as I trusted him and that he did a good job. End of February the developer said we were almost finished and the project was ready for testing. He helped me with renting a Dedicated Server and I approved the Last Milestone on March 3, 2021. Since then communication has become less and if he replies he says he is busy with uploading the project to the Dedicated Server, or there are some problems with the code and the server.  Last communication from the developer was Thursday 25th March, that we would have a call on Sunday 28th March and the project would be ready for testing. Today it's Monday 5th April and I haven't heard from the developer and he does not reply to my many messages. What should I do? What are my options?

A few years ago I used your service to hire a sales guy who seemed very good.

Now I thought I'd give you another try looking for a web developer.

Its impossible to reach Upwork customer service. I recently joined Upwork for outsourcing some basic activities of the order of $80 - 100 per month. Thinking Upwork being reliable name, I linked my Credit Card and to my surprise Upwork start billing me some $50 per month without my knowledge. I could not find any comms in my email where I got a notification that I will be billed $50 going forwards and only realised it after checking my Credit Card payments. A very fishy kind of experience.  I immediately disabled Upwork PLUS, but don't understand why for such low budget clients you will be charging that kind of monthly fee ? Feels like fraud and lack of both compliance & communication controls at Upwork end. I would surely like to ask for refund of such monthly deductions.  Below are my Transaction details1. 19-Mar-2021:  Reference ID3683606632. 19-Feb-2021:  Reference ID361458076

	High keyboard / Mouse rates but no input from the freelancer
","Apr 2, 2021  11:00:54 PM","
Hi everyone,I have suspicions that a freelancer is using an activity bot to generate fake keyboard strokes/mouse movements.  I have reviewed their activity and the active window has not changed for over 2 hours. Also, there's no actual input generated in that window as we have shared access to the specific page and I can see their input.  However, looking at the activity tracker there are keyboard and mouse activity generated (attached) but in a very un-natural pattern.Is it possible that I'm missing something or the freelancer is using a tool to generate that activity?

	Removing a hired freelancer
","Sep 23, 2018  11:22:44 AM","
I'm a happy Upwork employer. However, I recently had a bad experience with a freelancer I invited to a job, messaged, and then hired  – and who then did nothing. He didn't respond to any further messages or enter any time in the work diary. After three days, I ""fired"" him and ended the contract. I wanted to give him negative feedback, because he caused me a delay and inconvenience. However, Upwork seems unable to do anything because no work has yet been done on the contract. (Exactly!) The real problem is that he still shows up at the list of my recent hires. Every time I see his face, I get annoyed. How can I remove this freelancer from my Hires, and/or give him feedback so that other employers don't have a similar problem with him?

	Deadline missed and need to edit completion date
","Mar 31, 2021  10:52:57 PM","
Hi, days ago my freelancer and I agreed to push the deadline to a later date than the final milestone date (today). After asking a couple of times, she has repeatedly stated that she will let me know when is best but was not ready to state a date at the time. Today I suggested another date and again she has pushed the time to let me know by ""tonight"" which has not happened. I don't want either of us being penalized for this, I just hope to edit the milestone to a later date but I cannot see any way on my end for this change to be possible. Please advise if she (the freelancer) would be able to push the deadline date to a later time - assuming I would have the ability to review and accept the proposed date change with no consequences on either end?

	Feature Needed: Saved Talent Freelancers SORTING Function (Instead of just Search)
","Mar 17, 2021  09:30:18 AM","
In the Saved Talent screen, I have 7 pages of individuals. Searching never helps me, because these freelancers have varying skills and I can't remember all of their names in order to search for an individual. Based on previous support threads about confused clients, trying to sort through the Saved Talent screen, this categorized sorting method is essential and a few years overdue. Searching the Saved Talent list can still be used to search for specific skills and names. However, all of the other criteria are simpler to quantify, so they should be categorized. These sorting categories would live under a Sort icon, in the upper right of the Saved Freelancers screen, where there is already plenty of room. Clicking the Sort icon then drops down sortable categories that filters the list. Many of these sortable categories already present themselves in the New Job creation template. I attached a couple of Sort icon samples. Others can respond to this thread, with more categories, but these are my primary ones: NameHourly Rate - Currently-posted freelancer's hourly rateHourly Rate When Saved - Hourly rate, posted by the freelancer, when we originally added him/her to the Saved Talent screenHired - whether/not the freelancer was hiredNumber of Currently-active Jobs (determine how busy the freelancer is with his/her current responsibilities)A couple categories should expand further. These first three categories can match up, exactly, with the job creation template's options: Amount earned on Upwork - This category can get sorted, by itself, and also expand to subcategories for $1 earned, $1k earned, nothing yet earned, etc.Job success on Upwork - This category can also get sorted, by itself, and then have subcategories for 80%, 90%, etc.Geographic - Further sortable by continentNotes - Whether/not I have personal notes on the freelancer. Many of us label our Saved Talent with keywords in their Notes. The Notes category should expand into a searchable field, where clients can search their keywords saved in Notes. Note: Integral to sorting is also a Ascending vs Descending toggle. This icon can get implemented for just numbers-based categories or for all categories.

	Client Team Hiring

Hello,A long-term client decided to add me to his client team and delegate the hiring process to me. The one thing that I'm not sure about and can't find any straightforward information on is the hiring process itself. Mainly, I don't know who will be charged for putting the money into escrow, me or my client?  When I go to hire a freelancer, as part of my clients' team, this is what I get: ""You will be depositing $# into escrow today. On your Transaction History report, you'll see an immediate escrow invoice and corresponding payment from your primary billing method."" So, does this mean that my account will be charged and not the client for whom I'm hiring? I'm quite confused.

	Freelancer I hired refuses to cooperate
","Mar 28, 2021  07:56:14 AM","
Hello, any help will be appreciated. I hired a freelancer to redo my email campaign. The original copy is a very long plain text email, and what i want is to shorten the email, add icons, images and hyperlinks to make the email copy more visual than readable. Before I hired the freelancer, we spoke on the zoom with these specific instructions, and i told him that i wanted to purchase the catalog instead for this work. He said he preferred being paid by the hour instead of the catalog, so i agreed and have him 10hrs. Now, the copy he gave me is the SAME COPY as my original very long email, except that he put in in HTML format (i specifically said i want the end copy to be in html). I reminded him that what i wanted was to redo the email campaign, and reminded him all instructions i said during our first meeting. Now he's saying that changing the email copy isn't within his skillset, and all he's willing to do is to remove some words and put the final copy in html. This is absurd, because i was very specific about what i wanted the first time. Now he's consumed all 10 hours i alloted for this work, and i am billed by upwork, but i still did not get the result i was looking for, plus the freelancer won't agree to redo the campaign per my original instructions. instead, he is saying that we miscommunicated. i do not want to pay 10hrs of work for nothing, i do not need an html copy ONLY of my already-running email campaign. now my financial account is suspended because i am not willing to pay for his work which i do not need. what do i do?

","Feb 16, 2017  10:19:24 AM","
It looks like I'm being double charged by Upwork.  I'll set a milestone and add funds to escrow, my cc is charged.  Then when I go to pay that milestone, my cc is charged again.  So far, I've paid $400 plus more than my freelancer has recieved.  Am I missing something? I've submitted tickets and I just get an email back that the charges are valid and the ticket is closed.  I need to speak with someone but no phone numbers are listed anywhere on the site. Has anyone else experienced this?  Trying to figure out what is going on. I apologize if this is a double post, tried to post earlier and it didn't seem to post. Thanks.

","Dec 13, 2020  12:14:24 PM","
I found **Edited for Community Guidelines** through upwork. She said that the Upwork rules say I need to pay her in U.S. dollars. I e-transferred her $300 USD to her office according to her requirements. I send to her my date of birth and exact date of the incident . Before her writing, I told her to carefully read all the legal documents I sent to her. I hope she can write this story to its fullest. She said in email she has written press releases in the past. The second day, she sent me a PDF. There are a lot of mistake, including her changing the date of the case, the name of the person involved, the details of the case, and the legal terms. She written a wrong story, because this seems like some copied generic complaint. It took my weeks of contact to her, and yet it doesn't live up to the expectations.I also found that we signed an invalid contract because she had written my name wrong. I send a email to her, I have difficulty getting reply from her. So I contacted the Complaints Services department of the Upwork may be able to help me with this.The Upwork said science freelancers who use the platform are not employees of Upwork, refunds would be issued by the freelancers themselves.We do have a dispute process, however in part, the qualifications include a contract on the site and payments must be paid on the Upwork platform. Dispute an Agency or Freelancer’s HoursIn this case, since there was no contract on the platform and the freelancer was paid offsite, our options are limited. If you choose to pursue the freelancer legally, Upwork will cooperate with official legal requests. requests.**Edited for Community Guidelines** is a registered member of your company, we were use of Upwork tool for business communications. you have the right to deal with her deception of Upwork registered customers, you need to protect the client. she asked me to pay in U.S. dollars in the manner required by the Upwork company. If it’s an out of account payment, why did she email me to tell me to follow Upwork rules ?She should refund me, In Canada, If the Law Society refer her to me, I don't need pay the US dollar to her. The Upwork Service should solve my refund issue.

	Hourly or fixed price preferences and issues.
","Sep 12, 2017  07:41:19 PM","
Hi, so my first question is what is everyones preference on hiring hourly or fixed price. Also if you can tell me about an conflicted experience you had with either. Here's mine: So i posted an hourly job for someone to illustrate a logo for us with a character in it (not just text). Found an artist that we really liked his portfolio and after talking to him I asked him to make a quick sketch so I would know he understands the job. The sketch took him less than 5 minutes. All he had left was to add color and text for our logo name. I was thinking because that took him less than 5 minutes to sketch, it wouldnt take him long at all to finish everything and hired him at HIS hourly rate ($16) for 5 hours. He didnt accept and said he wanted more money. Now because of this, the rest of my contracts have been fixed prices and Ive noticed that Im paying 4-5x the amount I would be paying if I had hired them for an hourly rate. My next hire had an amazing portfolio. We hired him because we loved his illustrations and not because his cheap hourly rate ($7). We had him do two seperate jobs and after explaining to him what we wanted done, both were completed and back to us within 3-4 hours. We paid over $100 for each job. Though i believe his hourly rate is wayyyyy too low, have any of you all had similar experience with hourly and fixed price issues? Also what have you all decided to do about it?

	Freelancers sharing contact info and using scheduling apps
","Mar 25, 2021  11:00:03 AM","
I posted a job recently and 9 out of 10 freelancers sent me personal contact information and/or their Calendly or similar links, sharing contact information pre-contract and using their personal/non-Upwork Zoom for meetings. We were told pretty clearly with the new communication rules in the TOS that Calendly and other scheduling apps were not currently supported and were outside the TOS.  How am I supposed to hire a freelancer when 90% are violating TOS? Either they are ignoring the TOS change or they've decided to run the risk, which I can understand because the communication rules create a huge workflow issue for many of us in terms of having to spend so much time scheduling.  But on top of the time I have to spend scheduling, I have to decide if it's worth my time to respond (if I'm actually interested in the freelancer) and explain the TOS and then ask them to send me some times. It's creating significant bottlenecks in my hiring on Upwork. Additionally the site is so slow it took me 15 minutes to actually post the job because I was waiting for each page to load for a significant period of time. And my internet speed is ultra fast.  So what am I supposed to do, report every freelancer who has responded with their personal contact info or calendly link? I feel uncomfortable every time I have to respond to these freelancers about the rules, and then wondering if I'm working with someone who just is unaware or who doesn't care about TOS, which is not someone I want to work with.

Because of the system on Upwork, if she doesn't give me back a review, whether good or bad, my bad review won't show up on her profile, thus continuing the cycle of scamming other clients to think she'll do a good job because her JS Score has always been 100%. Isn't there a way to report her account so that other clients don't get scammed by this freelancer?

I'm in discussion with a client who says they work for XYZ company. After looking at the company website and searching online, I don't see this person listed on XYZ company as an employee, but I do see that they are part of ABC agency. I asked if it is work for XYZ company, or for an agency of behalf of XYZ company, and they said it is work for XYZ company. I understand that it's common for angencies to hire freelancers to help with projects, however, not being forthcoming about it does raise alarm for me. Would anyone else feel a bit concerned?

	Freelancer Filed Dispute
","Sep 2, 2016  05:57:55 PM","
I hired a freelancer for a milestone based project. When the freelancer missed the deadlines he agreed to and delivered NO work I ended the contract. The freelancer claims he did work (although he submitted no files) and filed a dispute. I do not agree to pay him because I don't beleive he did any work and wasted my time for about a week. Now I am left with the decesion to go to arbitration which is almost the amount in question and it's possible I could be told I need to pay some amount beyond the arbitration fee making it more than the milestone amount. Since I agreed to pay the freelancer only on delivered work and there was none, and because Upwork is refusing to make a decesion based on the facts I am left with no other choice but to dispute the charge with my credit card company. However I am unsure what effect this will have with my status with Upwork and if it could limit my account. Not sure what to do here as the freelancer has nothing to lose by disputing and I on the other hand can be out hundreds of dollars. I feel like the freelancer is gaming the system and Upwork has been no help what-so-ever. Please share opinions...

I'm about to lose my mind trying to find a way to contact support. Why is it so difficult??I get as far as this page https://support.upwork.com/hc/en-us and I can't find an article that solves my issue. I click on the thumbs down button to indicate the article is a waste of time, but there is still no further option to contact support. What a joke! They are happy to charge fees but can't provide support to their clients.I want to end a contract where the virtual assistant can't perform the tasks I've hired them to do. While I would never hire them again or recommend them to anybody, I don't think it would be fair to leave them public feedback saying so. I also don't want to leave a good rating as that would be misleading to other people looking to hire. I just want to quietly end the contract so we can go our separate ways. This however doesn't seem to be an option with Upwork, even if I provide private feedback, they still want me to provide public feedback. Does anyone know a way around this?

	Scammed by freelancer - what are my options?
","Mar 16, 2021  07:12:12 PM","
Hi,
 
Been using upwork since 2014, and worked on tons of projects here but now I think I got scammed for the first time.
 
Background
 
Hired freelancer to do some work on Amazon Web Services. Freelancer gave good impression etc., did some work in the beginning of the contract. 
 
Freelancer logged all time as manual time. 
 
I did not mind the freelancer logging everything as manual time as I had a good impression of him, but things were dragging out and I become a bit suspicious.
 
I googled the freelancers name, and find multiple articles showing he has spent time in prison as recently as 2019 for hacking and destroying his former clients business.
 
See e.g.
**Edited for community guidelines**
 
After I found out about above, I wrote him that I wish to have a meeting with him due to my concerns + removed the possibility to add more manual time.
 
Freelancer immediately cancelled the contract stating that he does not want to work on it anymore because he cannot log manual time + reject all my meeting requests (4 totalt)
 
He reluctantly provide me with the work he has ""done"" - but reviewing the files i can see it is not related to my project. 
 
Options
 
What are my options here? I filed a dispute already, but the dispute only covers a fraction of the enter contract. Any other options?
 
Freelancers like this should be removed from the platform, this is outragous. 7 years on upwork and first time this happens.

	Upwork client has been harassing me via Upwork, Instagram, Facebook, and Email... what do I do?
","Mar 18, 2021  05:21:31 PM","
Hi all - I am fairly new to Upwork. I recently got my first gig on here, everything has been going well. Out of the blue, I receive an email based upon a proposal for a social media posting on Upwork. The client says they deleted the posting and wanted to contact me via email instead... I felt this was off and ignored the email. A few days later, I receive an Instagram DM from this person who went out of their way to search for me. I blocked them. A few more days later, I receive a Facebook message from this person. I blocked them. After that, I receive yet another email from the SAME person still trying to attempt to connect with me about this social media job. I don't know why they won't leave me alone and it's quite concerning that they are searching for me on all platforms. Now, I have received a job interview invite on here by the SAME person. She changed her last name slightly but I know it's the same person. The job posting just says ""Are you available for social media"" and shows that only 1 invite has been sent out. (AKA to me) I have now made my Upwork profile invisible, in hopes that non-clients can no longer view my profile. But at this point, this person has found me on all social media platforms and I feel quite alarmed that they are so persistent on reaching out. What do you do in these situations? Has this happened to anyone else? I don't want to wish this upon anyone else but I'm wondering if this is common or if this perhaps happens to everyone at some point...  All thoughts and recommendations welcomed. Thank you .

	Freelancer rude, bullying, demanding money without work completion and blaming me for his mistakes
","May 18, 2017  03:43:53 AM","
			
				
					
					
						Hi, Few days ago I posted a job to develop a mobile app and I selected a freelancer for the job. I selected him because his profile looked good and the quotation was fitting in my budget. After he initiated the contract, he started using inappropriate and offensive language and started blaming me for not paying without even submitting the milestone. He kept saying that my budget was less and he didn't do project of small budget because he was earned enough on upwork and he didn't care for small budget projects. In the beginning only we had this discussion that for any milestone, whatever he develops, I will first test the code on my machine and then when I am satisfied, then only i will release the payment. As we both are protected by upwork policies, there should not be any problem with this arrangement. But he kept blaming me for not paying and put a lot of allegations on me. Also used offensive language. I had a very heated argument with him last time and I wanted to report it to upwork but when I was doing that he came back, apologized and agreed to share the code. I forgave him and after testing the app, I released all the payment. Again last week, when I had a new requirement on the same app, I contacted him and rehired again. And I clearly asked him if he was okay to first release the code so that I could test it and then release the payment. He said okay to that. I have the whole chat with me on Skype and on upwork. Now today when I tested the app, I found a very bad quality development and I asked to fix the app, he started demanding money to which I said no, because as per the arrangement, I wanted to run it on my machine and test it properly. He started threatening me and asked to release money in 20 mins and when I didn't respond, he ended the contract from his side and mentioned - 'Client failed to Pay', Which is an absolutely false allegation. Every time he brags about not caring for small amount jobs because he has already earned so much on upwork. He is not keeping his words and blaming me for his actions. I have following issues with this freelancer - 1. I thought he was an individual but he is not, every time i chat with him, different people respond. 2. His profile picture may be fake 3. His resume may be fake 4. He has blamed me for not paying, which is not true at all, I have 5 star rating on upwork and till today I have paid every single penny that I owed. 5. He thinks he is doing a big favour for me by developing my app because he already has earned $100,000 on upwork ? If he doesn't want to work, why did he waste so much of my time ? 6. He demands money almost every day without even submitting the complete work which is unethical 7. He is using offensive language and putting false allegations on me without any reason. 8. He says he doesn't care about any upwork policies because he has already earned enough. 9. His responses and allegations have given me enough mental stress and this makes me fuming almost every day 10. He didn't provide bug fixing support for his development, even when it was clearly written in the contract. All this came when the contract was over. 11. Despite all that issues last time I gave him good rating because i wanted to end on a good note and I thought that we solved all the issues last time that's why I hired him again but he ended up doing the same thing and went extra mile and abused the contract. He ended it after wasting 4 days of my precious time and without submitting the final code. He didn't even fix the defects. I am not happy at all with all this and that's why I am writing to this forum. My questions are - 1. What can we do in this case, I dont want him to trouble other people like this. 2. If he thinks he has earned enough on upwork, why is he applying with low quotes and then later saying that he is doing a favour. How can we stop this ? 3. My work is not completed as it was left midway and he ended up the contract. He wasted 4 days of my time, what can we do to stop him to do this to other people ? I hope you understand how badly hurt I am with this freelancer's behaviour, work ethics and false allegations and I hope that you will help me with this situation. Please let me know if you want to know the details of this freelancer, this might save someone's day. Looking forward to hearing back from you. Thanks, Abhishek.

	Too late to reverse charges, so I need to file complaint.
","Mar 18, 2021  08:37:35 AM","
I have a situation with a freelancer who clearly you did not represent his capacity or engage in good-faith and this was revealed only after payment. I'm guessing that payment is lost - but this person should be confronted or removed from the service.They were basically trying to get full payment up front and off the site here so they could turn around and pay someone else to do the work. The job was clear abuot schedule and he made it clear he was ready to go and could start right away on a 4 day schedule but then added a week to let payment process which of course broke our required schedule entirely.Since the person knows full well how payment works and agreed to Upwork payment and reported they were ready to go, when it seems they intended to turn the work over to another freelancer and was unable to do so and I think it's worth flagging as unreliable conduct.I paid half, and I was shocked by his handling of it and I'd be happy to share the entire email thread with Upwork. I talked to the Upworkd ""bot"" who basically suggested I post here, I can't seem to find any other way to flag a contract.I'm hopeing someone from Upwork will reach out.

It would be really nice to have a ""Task list"" in each contract - as often with a lot of back and forth messages, it can be hard to keep track of what has and hasn't been done.Obviously we could use an external software like Asana or Trello, but a simple task list (with the ability to click on any specific message and pin it/turn it into a task) would be very handy.

Then two days later o get charged another $60.00, does the same amount you paid the freelancer go towards Upwork as a company ?

They got in touch with me and said that they could do what I was asking, but I'd need to sign a contract with them outside of upwork and provide a down payment before they started. I have not encountered this before and am wondering if I should consider it to be a red flag?

	How to post a job as a freelancer
","Jun 10, 2016  04:19:16 AM","
Hi everyone, Hope someone can help me out here. I'm registered with Upwork as a freelancer but I'd like to post a job and hire a freelancer for a personal project (i.e. I'd like to become a client). Upwork is making my life very hard to do that. I'm wondering if there's a trick that I'm missing? I know I can always set up a new account as a client but that's a pain in the neck. Thanks!  Also specifically to Upwork (hope you're reading this):The UX is really confusingIt's hard to post a message here. There's a pencil icon on the left but that's for ""Register"" instead of ""Write a message""I missed the ""Post a new message"" button that popped up when I was typing in the ""Search mesage"" searchbox until I disabled my whole pop-up blockerThe Help articles are useful in a very limited way. What if I can't find an article that I want? In other company websites, there is usually a ""Contact Support"" option when you're really stuck or urgently need support without wasting time wading through discussion threads. Which brings me to my second point ...Support is unclear: Why indicate support chat when it's not available? I clicked on support chat, but that requires me to log in, and when I do, it takes me to the Help articles which is extremely frustrating. I looked for a support phone number, finally found one in the list of offices webpage, but that number isn't even a 0800. No support email address either.Now linking back to my original post: Why make posting a job as a freelancer so difficult?!Sorry I know I'm a bit annoyed here but these concerns are legitimate, and I'm sure others have experienced them too. I appreciate that there's lots of features on this website but personally I think quite a lot of them are just bells and whistles - for example, as I'm typing this, there's a column on the left showing ""Top Solution Authors"" and so on ... why would I want to know that? (Now I'm getting really grumpy sorry! BTW love the clean, high contrast interface but please please please reduce the clutter. Ah I'm off again ...) Thanks again!

What is the best way to find freelancers that speak this language? I haven't found the perfect way yet. Yes, when I create a job I can add those skills and that works quite well. But sometimes I don't get many applicants, so I'm looking manually for potential candidates to invite them to my job. In the filter options I can add German as a language, but this gives me just about anyone who remotely has anything to do with the language. Only about 5 % of the results are worth considering. I could also set location to Germany, but I actually don't require people to live in Germany and I'm looking for people who can work for lower rates, like digital nomads that speak German and want to finance their way of life. Is there any way to filter for people that natively speak a specific language?

	Ripped off by Upwork $29.99 premium posting (deceptive practice?)
","Mar 11, 2021  05:40:25 AM","
For my tech startup project I need to hire multiple testers in different countries to try the app and give feedback for the development team.  I don't have the luxury of waiting for random people to respond (if they respond at all).  As in any startup, speed and agility is the key.  Inviting freelance testers is the fastest way to hire them, win-win for both sides.  So after 15 invites I am told I hit the max.  Upwork asks that I pay $29.99 to have ""unlimited"" invites.  I begrudgingly paid the steep price to hire people to test the app, and comes to find out the invite is not ""unlimited"", there is a limit.  Once you hit this limit you have to wait 24 hours or ask Upwork to remove the restriction by submitting a form with reason.  They said it's to prevent spam and fraud.  Cool, I'm trying to hire and not spam.  But the submission form doesn't work, can't submit anything.  I tried chat support, no luck, they can't remove the restriction even though Upwork said it's possible (see attached).  Tried calling, explain the sense of urgency and I paid $29.99 why am I being restricted?  Phone support can't help either.  E-mail Upwork, and not even an automatic reply.  This is terrible customer service and deceptive business practice.  As a long time paying client of this platform I'm very angry and felt like I've been cheated out of money with no resolution insight. It's 2021, Upwork is still operating in the 1990s...

						Hello Community,A freelancer that I hired doesn't meet deadlines. 90% of the project was done, and I was promised that the last milestone would be finished in 3 days maximum, but in fact it's already more than a month, and it's still not finished. I didn't want to end the contract because that person knows it well due to the fact that he was the only one who's been working on it. Maybe I'm too naive to believe people when they promise something, but maybe there's a way to solve the problem.Any suggestion would be appreciated. Thanks.

	What happens to the money funded when the offer to the client is withdrawn?

 I am a client and I posted a job, then offered the job to a freelancer then decided to give the job to another freelancer. Now,  I withdrawn the offer to the first freelancer and offered it to the second freelancer.  In either cases I funded the job in Escrow, but now I seem to lose track of the funds for the offer which I declined. The problem is that: My visa was charged twice. So, if I withdrew the first offer, where would the money go?? I can't find them in my balance under (Reports/ translations). Please help. Thank you

Hi there, I hired a freelancer and she ended the contract one-sidedly and explained to me that the job requirement was beyond her capability. So I ended the contract also. 
 
The money hasn't been in Escrow yet and is currently showed as Proposed Bid. My question is how can I get that money back? And if I'm to hire a new freelancer for this job, would the money be transferred to that freelancer? 
 
I send below the current stage of our contracts. Thanks in advance for answering my concern.

	Freelancers work diary

Hi! I'm having a guy that's doing SEO of the website. However, the work diary is kinda suspicious. Engagement level is always around 9-10/10. Work are being billed with 9-10/10 engagement for like continuous 5-6 hours in a row (without any break between). **Edited for community guidelines** Work diary tells me that he almost doesn't use his mouse clicks. There are maybe like few clicks like in first 10 minutes, and then nothing. **Edited for community guidelines** I'm feeling like i'm being kinda tricked here. Since I'm not proficient with SEO and results are not visible instantly, it's hard for me to judge whether he's doing good work but his clicks are not gettings tracked (despite sometimes they do appear in word diary) or just trying to trick. Have any of you experienced something similar?

It is important to note that I have been a customer of the site for years, love it very much and enjoy working with it, I want to find out what to do before the case degenerates into an unpleasant situation, does such a huge site have no insurance? Warranty on my credit card sitting with them?As a customer on the UPWORK website, is my credit card unsafe ?! Do I have to be afraid because they have the credit card?Someone opened a ""freelancer"" user and then hacked into my UPWORK account and confirmed to his freelancer account a contract with hours without my approval, and all this without me having any contact with him, no job offer / contract. So every week he stole money for several months, I contacted UPWORK and they wrote to me that they contact him ""ask the freelancer to return and if he does not return they have nothing to do because it is money already transferred to him"" but obviously someone stole and approved a contract for his freelancer. Does such a large site have no anti-burglary security mechanisms? Like IP blocking in hacking attempts? Do they not have ""insurance"" against theft? I'm really scared and frustrated, is there a lawyer here in the group who can lend me a refund?I have no ability or desire to give up the money stolen from me

I accidentally paid bonus in the same amount as the billed amount for the contract,  without realizing I've paid for the job already. Basically I've double paid.  I saw the ""pay"" button so I thought that was the way to pay for the job. Since my credit card will be charged within 24 hour ,  I'd appreciate it if you could help cancel the bonus payment asap. I've found that Upwork does not show how much clients have paid for the job already. It only shows billed amount - but have clients been charged or not??  It would be a big improvement if upwork can show the total amount paid for the job. It would be a bigger improvement if Upwork allows clients to pay for freelancers only after they review the job and approve the payment.  Thanks.

	Pending refund (fixed price) from fake/bot Freelancer -- still on upwork
","Mar 5, 2021  06:49:09 AM","
Not sure why this ""freelancer"" is still online and with an Upwork account. Fake accounts like his takes opportunities away from real freelancers and burns time and energy from clients. Not sure what the ""**Edited for Community Guidelines**"" account is up to, but it doesn't appear to be anything productive.  
 
I hired him because he was first to reply and it was a small quick job. I wanted to give the new guy a break and chance to get hist first 5 star positive feedback. He was using a different picture for his avatar when hired (completely different person) and changed it to this stock photo shortly after hiring him. He also seemed to have changed his timezone/location around which was another factor in initially choosing him. Since we needed the work done in ~4 hours, or same day at worst, didn't want to hire someone where it was already 1am.
 
I missed my original deadline due to the fake ""**Edited for Community Guidelines**"" account, but I was able to get what needed done the following day, by an outstanding freelancer.
 
Upwork -- appreciate if you will please promptly review this ""**Edited for Community Guidelines**"" account (remove) and return my escrow.

	Dispute with Freelancer
","Mar 4, 2021  10:43:13 PM","
I hired a freelancer to do a fixed rate job. I paid the first milestone when she gave me the second draft of my book cover. I gave her the requirements for my files from the publisher. When she gave me the final files I submitted them to the publisher, but they were both rejected, She did not follow the requirements. This will cost me more money with the publlisher to upload the files again. The freelancer offered no solution to fix the files and obviously doesn't understand what the publisher wants. I have had to hire someone else to fix the files. I do not want to pay the final payment, but she is pressuring me and says when I pay she will give me editable files. How do I handle this?

	Can a client provide a review to the freelancer after a contract is closed?

Hello,Is it possible to provide a public review for a freelancer after the contract is closed?

	Freelancer is unable to complete the project and negative attitude
","Aug 8, 2020  07:15:27 PM","
Hello everyone, Over the last one week I am struggling with my freelancer. I have contracted him (with clear and well articulated scope of work) to develop a code for me. The deadline was 23 July 2020. However most recently while I started to review the deliverables, I found lots of gaps, issues and plaigrazing (privacy agreement etc). When I raised my comments and concerns to him, he started to react aggressively and negatively. I have raised a dispute but with deep respect is it s useless and it is not giving any opinion nor judgment based on the crystal clear facts provided by me and the fake claims the freelancer's making. I have even offered a bonus plus decreasing the scope of work but he is still playing games and not willing to complet ethe project. I have already paid two milestones plus one in escrow with a total value of 1900USD plus other third party costs.  Kindly advise how to get the job done OR how to get my paid money for the previous milestones.

Hi ,I would like to ask the community what would I do if the freelancer doesnt respond to my messages . Its been more than 15 days. Im really dissapointed with the freelancer because when I posted the job, she was sooo eager to do the work that I had rejected other requests ! I already gave her my original design and idea for my project. She worked so fast in 5 mins only showed me the result , I was not satisfied with her work and asked her to improve again and again. I even corrected and showed her how I wanted one by one, I think this kind of freelancer would use my idea for other clients ! She was at first suggested me to pay her via other medium not via upwork but luckily I didnt follow her request ! I want to leave a negative feedback on her attitude so that other clients would be aware of this lady. please give suggestion and the next step for me to take action TQ

	What invoice is valid?
","Feb 25, 2021  06:09:36 AM","
Hinew here.As far as I see, after a payment done on Upwork to hire a freelancer, as Client, we receive one invoice.....But later appears something called ""Credit Memo"" and later a new invoice, automatically generated by Upwork on behalf of the Freenlancer. So, my question is: The invoice of Upwork to the Client keeps valid? Both are valid? Or only one of them? Hoping for good news, since already found old topics, explaining/complainning: In most countries in Europe, a simple document saying invoice, from an individual it is not a valid tax document. If Upwork wants to say ""the Freenlancer"" needs to issue invoice, this simply does not work in Europe, since most of people are not and wont be registered as businnes. But Lda/LCCcompanies, we can not make payments without an invoice.We must receive an invoice from whom received the payment/made the debit in our account (and this party issue their invoices to the Freenlance).  Sorry for the advance though, I really hope at the end, there is a way to get a valid invoice from Upwork directly.

	Reporting possible fraudelent activity by freelancer and pause payments.
","Feb 22, 2021  07:07:10 AM","
Greetings,
 
I've hired a freelancer, and upon looking at the work-diary screenshots, the key-logs are all the same numbers, each minute. For example, 2000 key activities, each minute. This happens over and over. Also, in the screenshots, there is no change in activity being done by the freelancer.
 
Incidently, the freelancer has a Work Doctor app running on their machine, which pops up and says that they have been inactive for more than 20 mins, and upwork captures the screenshot of that too.
 
I am attaching a few screenshots of the freelancer:
1) all keyboard entries are the same(or almost same)
2) this happens over and over again
3) no activity on their screen
4) zero mouse activity
5) an app on their laptop pops up and says that they've been idle.
 
How should I proceed with this case, and get UpWork to investigate, and pause payments till it is resolved?
 
Any help is greatly appreciated.
 
Thanks
Gary

	I'm brand new. Need an advice if a job I'm looking for is feasible and if it is, how much to pay one
","Feb 23, 2021  09:43:01 AM","
Hello, I'm brand new to upwork and before I post a job I want to get some advice if what I want is even feasible to do, as I'm not tech skilled, but then if it is, a further advice how much should I set the budget for that job, and maybe some other useful advice that I should know before I post a job, for example what kind of freelancers should I look for, or else. The advices would be very much appreciated. There are several possible jobs I'd like to get done. 1. When trading on tradeogre.com, the untraded amount of coins of the available amount of coins I traded with goes to active orders. That active order blocks my next trade, as it sends signal that I don't have enough coins to trade, so I have to cancel that active order in order to trade again. What I want to do is automatically eliminate that active orders, so my next trades are not blocked by those orders. Every time I click available coins button, the untraded amount should be shown in the buy or sell trade field, so I can immediately click to trade again, and not first go to active orders page to cancel those active orders that didn't come to fruition, so I can return to trade page to trade again. These unfulfilled orders should be automatically canceled, so that every time I click available coins button I'm able to immediately trade again. 2. When I make a trade on kraken.com, I want a log document to be created which would show me the exact price at which I traded coins, and exact balance I had before and after a trade, as well as the amount of coins traded. Also, I want that log document to contain the system's 'last price' that was indicated at the time I made a trade, as well as the buying and selling price from the Order Book, depending if I made a sell or buy trade. Once those prices are logged, I want to have a few more mathematical operations that would show me the percentage difference between those prices and exact difference between those prices in numbers. When I'm over with trades, I want all those trades to be exported to an Excel document, with exact number of orders and all the accompanying data which one order carries. 3. A console, add on, or software of some kind in which I would put the amount of fiat that I have, and then the software, with the use of integrated live coin price from tradingview or kraken exchange, would calculate the amount of coins I can get at a given price in real time. Then I would just copy/paste (with copy button preferably) that amount in the buy field on exchange, e.g. Kraken, and basically speed up the process of buying coins. 4. Indicator, or a script for tradingview charts which would imitate Pivot Points indicator (Pivot HL) with addition of percentual change from highs to lows and vice versa. So, in addition to price in the rectangle, the highs should contain percentual change from the latest low and vice versa. Also, there should be an option to show just price, or just percentage, or both. Thank you to all in advance.Alex

	The hiring process is broken.
","Jul 5, 2016  04:18:57 PM","
For 4 years, I have been a loyal Upwork client.  I've spent $143k on Upwork in the past 18 months (client feedback score of 4.99, currently have 12 open contracts). That said, I will not be using Upwork to fill the next job opening in my company.  The process of finding and interviewing quality applicants is simply too time-consuming and difficult, and every time I post a job it seems that the entire UX has been completely overhauled (usually making the process more confusing and difficult).  Here are some of the issues I have experienced in the past 48 hours while trying to fill a part-time customer service position: 1.)  I specified the required qualifications for this position (ie. at least 1 hour billed on Upwork, feedback score of 90%+, etc) but this makes zero difference to who applies for a job, since there's no way to specify mandatory qualifications (and disallow applications from unqualified freelancers). 2.)  The default sort order for the applicants list is ""Upwork Recommended"", which is completely useless as the ""recommended"" applicants are very often totally unqualified for the position.  For instance, in my recent Customer Support job post, I required applicants to meet the following qualifications: ""Must be a native English speaker"", ""freelancers only (no agencies),"" ""job score 90% or better,"" located in ""East Asia,"" with ""at least 1 hour billed"".... one of the first Recommended Freelancers in the list of applicants is an agency specializing in ""OpenCart Technology"" based in India with no hours billed, no feedback score, and an application letter written by someone who clearly speaks almost no English..... in other words, Upwork's top recommendations for this position include an applicant who meets 0 of the job requirements specified.   3.)  There is no way to filter the list of applicants, except for the option to show only shortlisted candidates... why can't I filter the list to show only those who meet X requirement?  How hard could that POSSIBLY be to implement?  4.)  I have to hit ""show more"" to see more than a handful of applicants at once... why?  If I accidentally click the back button in my browser, the list re-sets and I have to click the ""see more"" button 12 times to get back to where I was previously.  Why can't I simply check an option to display all applicants on one page? 5.)  The applicants list is just completely broken.  Many times, an 'archived' applicant shows in the main list, even though clicking on their application to open it in a popup window shows their application status as ""archived"".  The number of ""new applications"" changes constantly every time it's refreshed, sometimes showing 15 new applicants and other times showing 45+.... on this recent job post, I archived some freelancers at least 5-7 times and they still occasionally showed up in the main applicants list. 6.)  There's no way to search the list of applicants, so I had to scroll through 179 applicants looking for the name of a freelancer who was recommended by a colleague.   7.)   On some applications, the freelancers' feedback score is shown in the list of applicants (ie. ""88% job success"").... on others, there's no score displayed, even though when viewing the applicant's full profile there are multiple past jobs with feedback and feedback/job score.  Why can't the score be displayed on every application instead of only some?   8.)  I have no idea how the ""job success score"" is calculated, so it's essentially meaningless... one applicant to my recent job has complete a total of 3 jobs on Upwork, all 3 with a feedback score of 5.00, and yet her ""job success"" is only 88%.... how is that possible?  That doesn't make any sense. 9.)  What the hell does ""Rising Talent"" mean?  The Help page on this topic offers a vague, unhelpful explanation:  ""Rising Talent freelancers have great potential based on strong backgrounds in their fields and early success with their clients on Upwork. Rising Talent agencies are new agencies that either have strong backgrounds in their industry or is an agency started by a Top Rated freelancer.""  <== who decides what a ""strong background"" is?  What vetting process takes place?  How can someone be given this ""Rising Talent"" status when they've never worked a single hour on Upwork?  Why would being in an agency started by a Top Rated freelancer automatically give the same status to their agency members (who may have 0 experience / relevant skills for the job)? 10.)  I don't want to hire an agency for this latest job post, but I have agencies applying for the job (with a ""relevant contractor"" attached, which in some cases was also an agency and not an individual freelancer) and applicants whose profile says they're ""associated with"" 1-3 agencies.  The Help page does not properly explain the difference between these two types of applications, and two chat support reps gave me completely conflicting answers to the question.  Why the ambiguity?  Why not just allow either individuals to apply (meaning they get 100% of the salary if hired), or agencies (meaning you hire a company and they arrange a contractor suitable for the job)?  The confusion essentially has made me look only at freelancers without ""associated agencies"" shown on their profile.  11.)  What can I learn from a freelancers ""test scores""?  Nothing, as far as I can tell.  Some of our best freelancers have mediocre scores on English tests, but they speak and write English so well that a native speaker couldn't tell it was not their native tongue.  Also, there's not really any clear benchmark for what a ""good"" score is (ie. is 3.70 / 5.00 a decent score, or did the freelancer basically flunk the test?), aside from labels like ""top 30%"" which isnt meaningful if the other 70% of people tested speak 4 words of English and scored 2 out of 20.  Also, what is done to ensure an applicant hasn't hired someone or asked a friend to take tests under his/her account?   12.)  For this recent job I posted, I set a specific non-negotiable salary (stated explicitly in the job post description)... 80% or more of the applications I received bid at a different rate from what I had specified in the job post... why can't I set a specific rate for a job, and only accept bids from contractors willing to work for that chosen hourly rate? I find it almost laughable that, after posting over 100 jobs on Upwork in the last few years (99 hires), I can still list off 12 separate issues with the hiring process.  Granted, not all my complaints would be shared by other clients, but surely several of them are features that a) would benefit and be well-received by almost all clients; and b) could be implemented in a day or two by any competent programmer. Sorry to vent this publicly, but I simply cannot contain my frustration with the hopeless hiring process that seems to be steadily getting LESS user-friendly and more confusing, even though Upwork's fees and rates have increased dramatically.   Please, Upwork, listen to your clients and address the numerous problems with the hiring process.

I am new to Upwork and had a freelancer complete a project. I had initially created 4 milestones but was happy with the work after 2, so I clicked on 'end contract' and thought I could complete the payment for the rest of the contract in that step.

	I need to report a fraudulent freelancer.
","Apr 26, 2020  03:14:22 AM","
Hi, I need to report a fraudulent graphic designer.
 
I employed him to do up a logo for my new startup.
 
He came back to me with some designs, they seemed a bit generic but I accepted the work and paid him. 
 
I field tested the designs and one proved to be a favourite. I then ran it past another designer who found the design on an Adobe site. I checked the other designs and they were all copies!
 
I confronted him and he begged and pleaded for another chance - gave me sob stories about his income / family etc. He promised me new designs. 
 
First design he sent me was also a fraud so now I'm going to report him. It's really touch to get in touch with the support team here so I'm asking for help to report this designer here. 
 
Can someone assist? I've attached a couple of examples of his fraudulent designs - I'd like a refund and for his page to be removed so he stops his scamming for good.
 
Thanks for your help. 
 
Kind regards,
 
Crispin

	Freelancer incomplete job
","Feb 18, 2021  04:44:49 PM","
Good day, I hired a freelancer for a 4 milestone project for a website. After a few messages I decided to hired him and put $1000 in escrow for the 1st milestone. He then passed me to work with his team. The communication wasn't great but they were doing the job. We paid the first milestone and put another $1000 in escrow. After some messages and asking for changes the freelancer disapeared due to ""health issues"" and we kept wotking with his team. The communication from the team was really poor, they declined to speak on the phone and have went past multiple deadlines but they kept updating changes on the website so after a few months I released the second payment. I have been trying to contact them and they are avoiding all the messages and they haven't made any changes.  I was told the website would be ready at the beginning of October and it's February and it's far away to be finished. What are our options? If we cancel the contract, how do we get the work/coding that has been completed so far so someone else can continue with it? If they don't want to give me the work that has been done, can I get a refund?  Thank you

	Former freelancer bothering me?
","Jan 22, 2019  10:56:14 PM","
			
				
					
					
						Hello.Not too long ago, I worked with this freelancer on a project. He completed it and I was fairly happy with the end result, but later decided not to continue the project for personal reasons. We parted on very good terms.He messaged me a couple of weeks after completion of said project, at which point I explained to him very nicely that I had decided not to continue the project. I told him I would keep him in mind if anything new came up that matched his skills. He seemed to understand, thanked me, and I thought it all ended there.Fast forward to yesterday (about 2 weeks after our last exchange) when he messaged me again out of the blue, seemingly just to chat. I have other projects going on Upwork, so I log in often, and the message came when I was online. I know it might have been a coincidence, but it felt stalkish especially since there was nothing left to discuss. I was nice with him but tried not to move the conversation forward and didn't ask him any questions. He continued to ask general questions like how I was doing, how was work etc. It felt very awkward and made me uncomfortable because I didn't know the purpose of all this. I explained to him again that the project he had worked on would not be continuing, which was awkward in itself to have to repeat. He seemed slightly offended and said that he was just asking me in general. The conversation ended shortly afterward. The whole thing was weird. I couldn't tell if he just had too much free time in his hands or if he was trying to fish for a new project (he never asked directly) or if he was even trying to make advances on me. All I know is that the exchange was uncomfortable as there was no purpose in it.So I've been wondering: is it typical of Upwork freelancers to contact former employers out of the blue? Is this a way to try and fish for more work? And if so, how do people handle it? I am by nature nice to people, but this has me annoyed. To the point where I wouldn't give him more work now even if I did have something that matched his skills. It seriously felt stalkish, so I',d rather not have to talk to this person ever again. Anyone have similar experiences?

Hi All I don't currently use my limited company name in my profile. I use an alias which is similar. The problem with this is that the Compay name isn't appearing on my invoices either. Here's a few questions re this that I need help with: 1. What information (name, address, contact details etc.) do freelancers see about me/my company? I'm guessing what is seen will be different between a non-hired freelancer looking at a job post and a hired freelancer working on a contract for me, but I'm not sure how. 2. Can I have a different Company name and Invoice address on my invoices to that displayed to freelancers (hired or non hired)? I've been using ODesk/Upwork happily for 5 years now and have only had a few bad experiences. I think a level of separation between what Freelancers see and my official company details (that Upwork sees) would be useful. Is this possible? Thanks,Chris

This has taken me almost two years, since Mar 2019, to even face this and was hoping for opinions as to what to do...if anything at all.  I have avoided facing this entire subject as I paid over $21,000 dollars for a contract, my entire life savings, not much I know, but it was all I had and more.  I had big dreams shattered, and frankly I have been avoiding this as it was such a painful process.  At the end of the day I was and still am a little niave about the world of programming and all this freelancing stuff, so please bear with me. First, I accepted what appears to be an hourly contract on upwork starting Jan 2017 , but I have a signed statement of work (SOW) with the developer with a set dollar amount a deliverables.  What started as a $6,000 job, the developer kept adding thousands at a time, over multiple project manager update calls. Everytime we would talk and discuss the project I would have to reexplain concepts over and over.  I was told I didnt explain details in the original project which I did.  Everytime a new SOW was updated and signed.  For example, and again I am not programing/tech savy here, but I explained I needed my customers to have the ablitity to pay entry fees through Paypal and at the end of the service be able to be awarded money back to them if the achieved the objective.  I didn't care how that happend, but in the end they explained the customers would need to have a wallet and that funstionality added another $3k to the SOW.  I know now, but I was the guy that said, ""wallet...like a bilfold that goes into my back pocket?""  I know, I know...I get it now, but this happened so many times that it just kept adding up and I tried telling that when we hit the $11,000 mark I was walking away and was going to report them. They then got THE BOSS on the phone with me.  This guy was a genius and got every word and explanation.  He knew exactly what I was trying to do and assured me his team could do it. Deep sigh...10K later I went through 3 project managers with the last being so disconnected and unfamiliar with my project I lost hope.  Our last conversation was me saying that there were so many undeliverables from the SOW and asking them to walk me through the system cause it was so chaotic that I couldn't figure out the flow.  They go on that call with me, clearly not prepared, asking me to walk them through the system only to get 5 minutes into it before they asked me to make a list of my issues and how it was going to cost more to fix them.  This was over a two year process to that day. I HAVE A PIT IN MY STOMACH AS I AM TYPING THIS! There is so much more to this story.  We had tons of calls, tons of correspondence through the Upwork chat. In the end, yes the contract was set to hourly.  I do however have a SOW with a dollar amount attached to it.  They billed me that exact amount mounting up to the SOW dollar amount. They never delivered.  I never ended the contract on Upwork and did not get the deliverable. Please let me know what you think I should or shouldn't do.

	Abuse? 100% success rate and ""top rated"" badge but no completed jobs.
","Feb 15, 2021  02:38:05 AM","
I was convienced that im hiring reliable person based on freelancer success rate and top rated badge, but looking at deliverables i was getting I've started to doubt his qualification. So i've checked person's profile **Edited for Community Guidelines**( and found that he has 0 completed jobs, no real feedbacks and bulk of his earnings on Upwork are coming from unverifiable private projects. 
Can someone explain me how that could happen? My opinion is that person is underqualified and somehow abusing Upwork rating system to get higher bid contractcts. Is it possible to be true? Can agency be unaware of such actions from the freelancer?Regards, Mike.

	Hiring a Upwork Freelancer as a Full-Time Inhouse Employee
","Apr 19, 2017  01:58:06 PM","
We love upwork and use it a ton in my agency.  We have a freelancer we have worked with for years on a full-time basis through Upwork.  I am considering exploring the option of bringing the person into my company full-time with benefits, time off, etc. I could not find out if Upwork has any process or policy of moving a freelancer from Upwork's system and into a direct relationship. Obviously I'm trying to do this within Upwork's guidelines as I plan to continue to use Upwork heavily for other needs. Thanks to anyone who can point me in the right direction.

	Problem With Credit Card

I just recently tried to hire 2 people and got this message:Sorry, we are unable to authorize this credit card. Please check the card information or try another card. Questions? Contact us.I have done the following:1. Opened up an online ticket on upwork and have had a long conversation with a member, who suggested that there is some issue with my bank who had issued the card. I again asked if there is any issue at your end, which she negated. 2. I called my bank and asked that I am facing this issue. They said that there is a ""Message Error In System"" which means that I am entering some wrong info while adding up my credit card. So, I repeated every single information and they said that the info is all correct. Then they ask for the postal code, which I told them that this option is optional. To which they reacted to add postal code. I added that as well but no success. They said that there is something wrong with the website and ask the team of that website to help3. I again discussed the issue in detail with the same member and she replied to add another card or to use other payment options.NOW MY QUESTION IS THAT WHY MY CARD WAS REJECTED EACH TIME, WHILE IT WAS THE SAME WHEN I USED TO WORK ON ODESK.COM.  Kindly let me know in a clear way what has happened to upwork.com? Are there changed in the privacy policies regarding payments? I am a lot confused and need immediate help. pleaseeeeee

Something to watch out for, I hired a guy (who had his identity supposedly verified by upwork) to do some non-sensitive work on a Wordpress site. He asked for some basic access to github and other services which were understandable. As the project went on for a day it became apparent he wasn't really familiar with how to do the work, but said that he needed my github credentials. This is obviously not necessary, and had created strange pretexts as to why he needed this.  Just a reminder that not all freelancers have good intentions. Always ensure you understand the full capabilities and limitations of the access you grant. Keep safe.

","Oct 24, 2017  06:57:55 AM","
Hi All,   I'm a small business owner who is also a programmer, and I've been developing my own retail product line for 16 years.   Over the last few years, business has got to the point where I needed to find some programming help.   A contractor I hired on Upwork (with a five star rating, over $200k earned last year) has stolen my source code, and created a new website to sell my products.  He changed only cursory UI elements, mostly images.  The screenshots on his website show my exact same UI, except for the images.  He did not bother to change the name of the 6 products he stole, nor the telephone number, which leads to his cellphone, which is how I found out who it was!   Besides contacting the web hosting provider (Amazon) and Google/Bing, what are my options?  He lives and works in India, and I am in the US.   I will definitely no longer hire programmers from Upwork after this experience, and only work with local people I can meet.   I will blog about my experiences, so that searches for this individual and his company show up.  I'll also post about my experiences in my small business/programmer professional groups to warn others.   Does anyone have any thoughts or advice for me?  Other than seeking a lawyer that is - I know that already and that's in progress.

	Talent Specialist Out of Control
","Nov 21, 2019  10:32:33 PM","
I posted a job today. I searched for FLs to invite. Did a very specific search and found the few unique unicorns (I know) that I thought were great fits. I also upgraded the job for the visibility. This came along with the offer of help from a talent specialist. At that point, I already had two interviews scheduled with two people I felt were strong candidates.  I did not get many proposals - only 5, including the 2 who responded to my invitation. But that's okay, I prefer quality over quantity.  Then some talent specialist reads my job post, decides on his own criteria to invite freelancers to apply and invites a whole bunch of totally inappropriate candidates to my job post.  WTH?! I did not ask for his help. I had communicated to him I had two interviews and was satisfied with that.  The TS should confer with the client before inviting random people to apply. It would help that if a TS wants to help they actually ask the client what the MOST important skill THE CLIENT is looking for, instead of randomly inviting people based on randomly chosen keywords in their post.  Also, the TS said he was available during certain hours, and he's not. He's emailing me outside those hours but then not available to respond. And not responding during business hours when he said he was reachable.  Is TS just a bot gone wrong? What a truly disappointing experience. I was excited to have found two people I was interested in. And then your TS got involved. Ug.

I am wanting to know if a contractor see my uploaded files after the contract is ended? He is still messaging me, even though I ended the contact 24 hours ago, for non performance. I am concerned he can still access the files I upload.   And therefore should I be removing the files?I have not worked out how to do that as yet thanksToni

	Sue Upwork
","Dec 16, 2019  03:22:18 PM","
I spent thousands on Upwork for a con-artist freelancer who claimed he could deliver my project as described in the project description. The project timeline was 1 to 3 months with clear, detailed deliverables. It's now a year later and they did not deliver a working application. We were going back-and-forth for months - he tried claiming it works and when I showed it doesn't work with explicit screenshots, etc. he told me after a day or two that it should now be fixed while it was never fixed. I contacted Upwork support over two months ago to get my money back, I showed them exactly what was going on with supporting evidence, they confirmed I was scammed by being charged thousands by freelancers who can't and don't plan on delivering the project deliverables, and to my surprise, all they offered was to pull me around the past couple of months just like my con-artist freelancer. They kept on telling me something like: Oh, I see, let's contact him again and ask him again to fix it again... I was fed up from playing these endless games and replied: Their response though was something like: I can understand the frustration, wasted time, money and effort only to receive a non-working software bla, bla, bla... but we will do nothing to help you get your money back because this was an hourly project and according to Upwork term of services they are technically just a payment processing platform and they take responsibility what so ever. I asked them a simple question: So I can technically go onto Upwork, claim that I build satellites, get a client to pay me $40 Billion for my so-called work and just walk away without doing my job if I do it on an hourly basis and Upwork will do nothing to help the scammed client get his money back? Their response was nothing short of assuring that I'm 100% correct, I could scam Upwork clients without paying any consequences as long as I do it on an hourly basis. I'd like to sue Upwork for:Allowing freelancers to scam me on their platform.Doing nothing to help me get my money back - thus, supporting the con-artist freelancer.Still allowing the freelancer's agency and its employees to operate on Upwork without refunding my stolen money - thus, being able to scam new clients.Falsely marketing itself as a secure freelancer marketplace and dispute mediator in case it's needed and hiding the real face of Upwork in the terms of service.Big tobacco firms were sued because of marketing smoking as a luxury while it is dangerous and not displaying a large, clear, bold warning message even though you were able to find a health warning in some legal terms and conditions fine print. If you were involved in a recent lawsuit against Upwork please let me know how you went about it, attorney references, etc. If you were involved in a similar dispute with Upwork, please let me know your story to join me in building the case against Upwrok in my lawsuit. P.S. Upwork, I've shared this discussion link in other online networks, doing anything to try to remove/disable/hide etc. this discussion will only hurt.

I clearly stated in the requirement specification that the ""Application Developer needs to create Applications based on the work tool website.""They denied straight and now are asking to add price for this feature.
I discussed a lot with them and tried to explain but they denied so I had only one option left as they did not submit the work they have done till now and I released the amount of the first milestone. I requested a refund, after my refund request, they apologies and want to continue work and I also want to give them another chance. how to cancel refund request?here I am not able to contact the Upwork customer support team directly this is really frustrating.

Hello everyone, I was wondering if you have any advice for me regarding how to properly keep track of all the freelancers I have doing projects for me and the hours they spend on each project. Although this may seem straightforward if you're constantly opening/closing contracts, I have several open contracts that I do not close since the freelancers associated with those contracts are producing a lot of creative every week. For that reason, it would be bothersome to always open/close contracts for freelancers who fit this criteria. Do you have any recommednations for me? Right now I do all of my own tracking through Google Spreadsheets and I use a few different key metrics to evaluate all freelancers, but I'm concerned about how sustainable that will be as I continue to grow.

	It looks like freelancers are allowed to hide bad reviews, is this true?
","Dec 25, 2018  12:49:54 PM","
I am reviewing some candidates for a new project I posted. Upwork has automatically categorized some of the applicants into a section labeled ""Proposals not matching your qualifications"". I understand this is an automated feature and given a typical job posting can have over 100 applicants, I appreciate it. And I also understand that there are many variables and algoriths that play a part in how/why a freelancer gets placed into this category, and I am fine with that. For this particular job posting, I decided to review these applicants anyway. One of the first things I noticed is that I did not see their average star rating / job success rate. Why not? Does Upwork allow freelancers to hide their ratings? With one particular candidate, when I read his reviews, half of his reviews are exactly 5 stars and the other half say ""No feedback given"". In other words, to someome who was not paying attention it would appear that this person is a 5 star candidate. A superstar. I would have assumed this person is a GREAT candidate because all of his reviews are exactly 5 stars. I don't think the freelancer is doing anything questionable or shady, and I believe in being rewarded for continuous improvement. It looks to me like Upwork is letting freelancers hide their bad reviews and in exchange, maybe their success rate is hidden? Is this true? Please help me understand whether or not this is the case. I am not quite sure yet how I feel about it. I guess I am just used to the old way and going forward when reviewing candidates, I'll be more aware of this. In the past, I would (almost always) automatically disqualify a freelancer with a success rate lower than 85%. But if success rates are now hidden, then it seems like it would be harder for me to vet candidates. Update:Actually, I just noticed that *many* applicants for my most recent job posting do not show a success rate - not just the ones that are categorized in the ""Proposals not matching your qualifications"" section. Again, I am in favor of second chances, but I can't help but automatically assume that if a freelancer is able to (and has) disabled or hidden his/her success rating, then there's something to hide. Sorry to sound biased like that but it's human nature I suppose. I've given my fair share of bad ratings when freelancers clearly mislead me or failed to complete a job. But I've also given many praises and positive reviews for those that deserve it. So if the rating system has any merit (as I believe it does) then I don't think some freelancers should be allowed to hide it.

Hello there Recently, I joined Upwork and unfortunately, I made a bad first experience. Part of it is my fault, part of it I have to blame on the freelancer. The job was on an hourly base with automatic time tracking, related to social media and I agreed on a 30h contract with the freelancer. The work he did in the diary did not make any sense, but every time I asked him about it, he told me that it is normal, because he does the most of his tasks on the phone. He told me from the beginning on, that he will issue me a full refund if he fails. After 30h, he failed to reach the anticipated goal. Only time by time I learned that an hourly contract with a fixed price would have made much more sense. He moved the conversation away from Upwork to Skype. He still told me that he would issue me a refund, but only after he got his payment on his PayPal account. He would then transfer it back to my account. As an explanation, he said, that he does not want to risk his success rate. Obviously, for me, it was clear that I would never see this money again if I do so. I requested a refund and opened a dispute, he rejected. He then contacted me via Skype again. Very pushy, almost threatening, he said that he will win the dispute anyway since his work diary was filled by the time tracker. I thought that this might be true. He eventually offered me a refund of 60% and I agreed. But, in return and before giving this money, he forced me to give him a five-star rating. He also wrote the review about himself and sent it to me. I was desperate and followed his instructions. After that, he refunded me a small part, asking also to close the dispute. In the end, I was so annoyed that I just wanted to at least have some money back, and I also did that. Well, and now that was it! Obviously, he did not refund me any more money and he got away with everything. I can understand that in the end, it is my naivety that led to the loss of money, but I am not sure if his behaviour is correct and not against community guidelines. For me, it was like he was following a plan from the scratch on of what he did, almost like a criminal. I have do admit that I was completely new to this platform and I only learned a lot of things during the first contract with a freelancer. Obviously, I would not act so naive in the future. Is there anything left I can do? Thanks

	Language Requirements?

Hi everyone! I'm building a small brand here in Sweden, and I´m looking for freelancers that can help me with ads etc. Now, it´s not the easiest thing to find someone working with ads that also knows Swedish. I´m wondering, would you regard that as an absolute necessity if hiring someone to help you with your ads? Or, would it be enough if that person knows English, and goes from there? I would believe it necessary to now Swedish. But on the other hand, maybe its enough to know the ""marketing language"" itself. Please share your thoughts here.  All the best/Erik

	Seeing when a message is read
","Dec 8, 2016  01:51:28 PM","
Hi! My name is Fernando, and I am a Product Manager working on the Collaboration Platform team here at Upwork. My team is responsible for everything that lives inside the Messages page, as well as all features that allow a freelancer and a client to work better together., One of the issues that come up most frequently when we review feedback between clients and freelancers is a lack of responsiveness. Things are going well, until one of the parties (the client or the freelancer) stops responding to messages and people get anxious to know whether it's just a delay or if people have seen the messages at all. In order to address that, we're considering adding ""message seen"" indicators to our Messages page (and consequently to the Messages window on the desktop app). If you've used mobile messaging apps such as WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger you will be familiar with this - being able to tell when someone has seen your messages. It would look something like this when you hover over a message (these are early mockups):   When we launch this feature, would you like to be able to turn it off? Bear in mind that this means you would also not see these indicators for when other people see your messages. Any other feedback you might have about this would be most welcome. Thanks!

	Help.  My Freelancer disappeared.
","Jan 23, 2021  08:23:22 AM","
Good Morning, I hired **Edited for Community Guidelines** to work on an ongoing project for my website. I received notification on last evening that his contract was abruptly ended for violation of your company's rule. Your company did not share what the violations were but this abrupt termination has left me in a bind. Should I be concerned? He appeared to be a great developer, who communicated well and worked efficiently. He also spoke highly of your company and recommended I use Upwork versus other companies to avoid being taken advantage of. Now I will have to start over with someone new, build trust with them and repay the new hire to continue this project and duplicate work. There should be advanced notice provided to avoid these types of interruptions. We were literally in the middle of working on something when the termination occurred. Your understanding and cooperation in this matter will be greatly appreciated.

	Freelancer used stolen, copyright content on website & did not do work. Resolution going nowhere.
","Jun 26, 2019  01:06:02 PM","
Hello Upwork community. I need help. I don't know what to do. I hired a freelancer to create a custom website for me. I provide the details and she misses the deadline. She then got back to me and said the work was 80% done. I checked the website and all that was there was a broken template, with links leading back to another website, selling the template. I confronted her about this and she claimed it was completely custom and she ""could not have used that template because it has to be paid for."" However, later she said she took ""ideas from the template."" And another time she even admitted to stealing the template with plans of changing things on it. I cannot pay her for copyright infringement. I also cannot pay her for not doing what I hired her to do. The case has been going back and forth for a while now, with nothing really happening. Upwork dispute team has not been too helpful either. My question is, since she violated terms of service, and the law, shouldn't I just be able to get my money back? Arbitration would be extreme in this case. Also, especially since the contract was for $300. I'm leaving the website up as proof, but I really want to hire someone else asap.

I am both a freelancer and a client. I've created a client account and was able to use it only once (right after I created it). These are the things I have tried: - Type Upwork.com on my browser (Chrome) and it send me to https://www.upwork.com/ab/find-work/ which is the freelancer's page. - Log out of my account, go to https://www.upwork.com/login, type in my login information, and it will also send me to https://www.upwork.com/ab/find-work/, which is the freelancer's page. - When I am logged in (as the freelancer), click on my avatar at the top right corner dropdown menu, click on the name of the client company I created, it sends me to this page: https://www.upwork.com/ab/jobs-home/4319793. On the page there is only one line of text read ""This page is for clients only"". I wouldn't want to create a new client account just to be able to use it only once. Thank you very much in advance.

Hi Upwork, First your site is great, very efficient and professional to contract freelancers. I was wondering if you could implement a ""meeting"" functionality to automate meeting planification with freelancers. It's somewhat cumbersome to ask for availability, check and double-check time-zones, when you want to plan a video call with a contractor. Maybe it could be easily automated. What do you think? Thanks, Vincent

	Client Location Information
","Jan 16, 2021  08:42:50 AM","
Hello, Interested Parties, Why does Upwork disclose the location information of clients to freelancers? As a paying client, I'm not totally comfortable with freelancers knowing my location. It's not like I won't pay them as Upwork requires payment information prior to hiring a freelancer. It's fine if Upwork knows my location, but is it really necessary for freelancers to know? I think it's a disadvantage to clients, who are the paying customers of Upwork and the creators of job opportunities for freelancers around the world.

	Reaching higher management
","Nov 23, 2020  11:09:08 PM","
I am not sure this subject belongs here, but I have no doubt I'll be told if it doesn't.I had a dispute with a Freelancer entity, filed an Arbitration against them, won and was awarded the maximum possible under Upwork rules. The Freelancer has yet to pay, though the Arbitration Award specified payment be made by November 4th. The dispute has been assigned to a Upwork Mediation Team Lead. Previously we were working with a Upwork Mediation Team member. I have encountered what seems to be an insurmountable communications problem with the Upwork Mediation Team Lead. I keep asking about two issues which the Upwork Mediation Team Lead simply doesn't answer. As a result, I am seeking a way, if possible, to escalate my issue to her superiors or higher management in general. The first issue is that there are two named entities in my Arbitration Initial Statement: the corporation (agency) and its ""business manager"". My complaint is against both of them and there is nothing indicating that the Award doesn't apply to both. I am told by the Upwork Mediation Team Lead that limitations have been applied to the ""business manager"", but the Upwork Mediation Team Lead has so far refused to tell me if limitations have been applied to the corporation. Upwork claims to strictly adhere to the terms on an Arbitration Award. If it failed to apply limitations to the corporation named in the Arbitration, Upwork is violating the its own terms of service. My share of the Arbitration cost was $291. I entered into the Arbitration in good faith, thinking that all parties would adhere to the Arbitrator's findings. If Upwork applies limitations only to one of two parties, then there is no incentive for either to pay me what I have been awarded and Upwork has not followed its own stated policies. That's the first reason I would like to find a way to reach the Upwork Mediation Team Lead's superior or someone in Upwork management who can investigate this situation and hopefully resolve it. The second issue is one arising from the Arbitration. The dispute with the Freelancer(s) is somewhat complex and could not be fully pleaded in the 1,500 word limit of the Initial Statement, so I stated that I would be seeking permission to file additional materials, which is permitted under Arbitration rules - if the Arbitrator permits it. In this case, the Arbitrator did not since I had pled sufficient facts to allow him to rule in my favor. So even though I won, not all the issues were settled. So the second thing I have been seeking from the Upwork Mediation Team Lead are directions on how to file another Arbitration, this time seeking posession of the intellectual property at the heart of the dispute. I have asked this question repeatedly both of the Upwork Mediation Team Lead and her predecessor and have not received an answer. I apparently can't file an Arbtration without Upwork's consent. Therefore I can't launch an action to gain possession of the intellectual property I have paid for and was guaranteed ownership of in the contract with the Freelancer. (My Award was for only part of what I had paid the Freelancer.) So if Upwork won't respond on this issue, I am stuck. I can't recover the intellectual property that the Freelancer was paid to develop. So again, I am looking for a way to contact the Upwork Mediation Team Lead's superior or someone in Upwork management to resolve this situation. Constructive assistance will be appreciated.Jerry

	Dispute
","Jan 17, 2021  01:06:06 PM","
I hired a CPA to do my taxes on Upwork and I agreed to pay $750 if my 1040 and quarterly taxes are prepared for me. After a few days back and fourth sending him all documents in the chat section, he called me on Upwork to discuss my taxes and as it turned out, he didn't even look at the info I sent him, nor prepared anything; he was struggling to find stuff on them. I talked to Upwork and I was advised to end the contract and I will get my money back (Saved the chat session and sent to my email); After a few moments, I get an email that the Freelancer disputed the contract. I'm now left with a decision to either, accept the dispute, or reject it and send it to arbitration. The average cost of hiring a certified public accountant (CPA) to prepare and submit a Form 1040 and state return with no itemized deductions is $176, while the average fee for an itemized Form 1040 and a state tax return is $273. I have uploaded $750 in escrow after he quoted me with no questions asked;  Now that I sent him all my private info and we are in a dispute, I'm worried about my private data (I know that Upwork have something in place for that) I was just wondering what everyone's thought was on this issue and what's the best course of action. Oh, by the way (My Small business have about 50 transaction mostly) with some minor deposits on my bank and all my sheets are organized) - He simply combined my 5 or 6 excel sheets into one) and told me that he never agreed to do my taxes for me.

	Very confused about my billing history/payments. Kindly help.
","Mar 11, 2017  11:53:52 AM","
 Good day! I apologize in advance for the ignorance about the billing in this platform. I am a new client here on Upwork. Since the beginning of my time here on Upwork, I've already spent around $ 144.20 on my projects. Payment is through VISA debit card.Here's the breakdown (not including the $ 2.75 payment processing fee):$ 54.20 is spent on approved milestones.$ 12.00 is in Escrow for current milestones not yet approved.$ 6.00 has already been refunded from one freelancer$ 72.00 is awaiting for refund approval (I ended the contract. However, my freelancer said she's sick but hasn't mutually ended that contract yet. Still waiting for it.) My summary of fixed price and other payments is: $ 54.20, which is accurate.However, I am very confused about the following:Fixed Price Deposits (not included in balance): $84.00Statement PeriodFeb 12, 2017 to Mar 11, 2017Beginning Balance $0.00Total Debits $213.56Total Credits $207.56Total Change ($6.00)Ending Balance ($6.00) Again, I apologize for the ignorance as I am new here on this platform. I really don't understand how the billing for clients works. I only understand that it adds 2.75% fee per payment to freelancer. 1) What does it mean by the total debits and total credits?2)Why does it cost more than my total expenditures on my projects? 3) I computed that if I spent $ 144.20 all in all, the payment processing fee will only be $ 3.9655. That would be a total of $ 148.1655. Am I correct about the additional fees?4) Does it mean that $ 213.56 and $ 207.56 has been withdrawn/transferred from my bank to my Upwork client account? For what reasons?5)Does my successful refund from a freelancer ($ 6.00) falls on the total change and ending balance?6) Are there any hidden charges that I am not aware of? Kindly help me with this. I appreciate all the help and knowledge I can get. I'm just worried that maybe Upwork charged me more than what I expected. Thank you very much.

Hello! I have recently hired one ghostwriter to write a novel for me and paid 150$ in advance. Now my money is in escow, and I know Upwork tells me that I can pay my freelancer for the work that I authorize. I just wonder, because I am going to hire many more freelancers, whether it is possible to not pay freelancers at all if they produce a low quality of work. I pay relatively high price for the project, so I want it to be in a good quality. Is it possible to not pay my freelancer if his/her work is in a low quality? If so, how do I get my money back from the escow system? Thank you.

Hi, I am trying to add my payoneer card as a billing method (want to use it to pay to freelancers). And get ""Upwork doesn't accept gift cards"". Well, you can reject gift cards all you want, but the one I have is a mastercard issued by Payoneer. It's not a ""gift card"".  What am I supposed to do? How can I validate my Payoneer card as a billing method so I could do business with you? Thank you in advance.

	How can I post a job without current contractors seeing it?

Greetings all - I'm use Upwork as a freelancer and to find contractors. I guess I have a good problem: I use a handful of contractors for work that I need help with, and I want to keep using them. The problem is my workload is growing and I need to re-post the same jobs so that my current contractors aren't overwhelmed. However, I don't want them to see my new jobs (which are the same as what they are doing). How do I post new gigs but keep them invisible to specific contractors?

	Matching invoices to credit card payments
","Jan 16, 2021  06:37:52 AM","
I've recently increased the number of freelances I hire on Upwork, and I am really struggling to make sense of the invoices now they are coming in in bulk and involving different jobs, contracts and freelances. What I need is a single invoice that matches the credit card payments - i.e. one that tells me which costs (per payment ID) have been added up to reach the total that I have been charged for.  Another person on this community spot asked the same question and was told to put it all on a spreadsheet. I've done that, but all that will help me do is link the fee, bonus and transaction fee for each separate contract together. It's a start, but it doesn't help me link the invoices to the debits on my credit card statement. I'm also being billed in dollars but charged in UK pounds. Why is it not possible for UpWork to raise an invoice per contract? Contract numberFreelance nameOpening escrow amount (opening balance)Amount or hours invoiced by freelancerUpwork Processing FeeTotal balance remaining from Escrow depositAmount due (or to be refunded) in US $Amount charged or repaid to hirer's credit card in US $ (and local currency if appropriate)One one statement or invoice?Thank you.

Hello. I tried for two days to accept a contract and make payment through my PayPal account and my credit card. Neither of these methods were successful.

	Report a Client (Blackmail/Coercion)
","Jan 15, 2021  01:39:56 PM","
Hello;
I'm looking for assistance with a current client.  He is seeing a drastic drop in sales at his company due in the majority to the nature of his business.  His sales exploded during the 2020 summer protests over George Floyd and BLM.  Now that that has died down, so have the sales.  He has become increasingly aggressive and hostile --actually yelling and screaming at me and other freelancers-- and rejects any amount of personal responsiblitiy even for things are are solely under his control (such as losing access to his own google search console, facebook busines manager and ads accounts).  I have witnessed him attempting to force other freelancers into continuing to provide support and assistance for him even after the freelancer has closed the contact.  He attempts to coerce them by making up reasons to claim they've performed poorly and threatening to give them a bad review unless they agree to continue to help him figure things out even after they've stopped working for him.  I do have recorded proof of what I'm saying here becasue he specifically asked me to begin recording the Skype meetings and he made these specific statements to me during one of those Sype calls. 
I am seeking help here now because I am now in that position. This client calls at random times throughout the day and goes on rampages, yelling and microscopically picking apart every task I am working on.  Even when he knows that other people have not provided the work and that he and I both have repeatedly requested it, he attacks me because it's not done. Now he is attacking me because I gave a positive review to one of our freelancers when I closed the contract after they finished their work with the company.   This freelancer quit after having been harangued by the client during multiple meetings.  Even though the client's grievance was in fact due to his own blatant refusal to learn how to keep track of his own primary account access details. The freelancer had done everything that he was able to do.  Most of what was asked of him could not be done because the client didn't provide access to the freelancer.  Now, because I did the right thing by not allowing this client to wrongly destroy reputation of another freelancer, I am even more in the crosshairs. 
After a few particularly agressive calls I let him know that I felt it would be best for me to conclude my work with the company.  I am certain that he will give me a bad review because he specifically asked me if I would stick around to work on other projects if he agreed to give me a good review.  That's his ploy.  If you don't bend to his will and let him keep pressing you for more work, he threatens to leave a bad review.  
I would like to know if there is any way I can refute this without destrying my solid record here on Upwork?  Please help.

	When I start a new contract, why is the freelancer automatically able to see/use ALL activity codes?

Each time I start a new contract, I have to go through my time tracker activity code list (currently 13) and remove that person from any activity codes they won't be using. It should be the opposite - when a new contract is started, the freelancer is by default added to none of the activity codes. This works better for both clients and freelancers. Clients who want to control just which activity codes various team members see don't have to constantly remove new hires from every. single. activity. code. one. at. a. time.My freelancers don't have to sort through irrelevant activity codes, which also leads to less mistakes. If this is a setting or something that I can turn off, I would greatly appreciate learning how to do so. If it's baked in behavior, I would very strongly suggest adding a fix for this to your roadmap. Thank you.

	Upwork Encourages Scammers
","Jan 7, 2021  01:14:54 PM","
After 2 years of dealing with negligence, my proposed 2-week project was never delivered. SCAMMERS are allowed to break terms and scam customers.I found Upwork when I was trying to take my business to the next level, which required custom dev work on my social media website. I posted my first job and received a few replies from freelancers with various proposed timelines and prices. After finding someone with ""good reviews"" and a price point within my budget, this freelancer gave me a 2 week window of finishing. Then, after a few weeks of back and forth, the freelancer tells me he didn't understand the scope of the project all of a sudden and said it would take a lot longer than he thought. So I continue to work with him week after week until all of a sudden this guy CANCELS my contract without notice and then proceeds to BLOCK me from communications. Furious, I contacted support in which the ONLY solution they gave me was to have me reinstate his access to my code to complete the project, which he never said he would at this point. In no way would I have expected Upwork to allow a freelancer to cancel without cause a contract just like that and then also allow them to BLOCK the person who hired them! I wasted 6 months and almost $2k just from this freelancer alone. Now, I have an unfinished project, so I proceed to find another ""qualified"" freelancer and found one within budget and a new timeline of 1-month. That goes by with little communication and no proof of work, so I file a dispute with the support team. Instead of looking into the matter in depth, they ended up canceling the contract because I did not respond within 48 hours by email. Mind you, they won't allow you to speak to any level 2, 3, on the phone. You simply cannot get a manager on the phone. So they canceled and I still have no project. The freelancer says we can start a new contract and that the new timeline is 2 months (after the already 2 months that have gone by). After that period, the freelancer stops communicating for over a month and so I contact support again. Back and forth and all they do is ask if I want a refund. I continue to tell them no and that all I want is the project to be completed as contracted, so they go to the freelancer and he agrees he will complete it. They didn't give a warning or put a hold or do anything to help the situation whatsoever. Another two months goes by and the freelancer now holds my project hostage and tells me if I don't release the funds from escrow that he will not deliver my project. By this time, support hasn't done anything to help so I reluctantly released the money bc I am out of options. Another 2 months goes by and I am in the dark, still haven't seen one thing for this project from this freelancer so I contacted support again. They gave us both copy/paste answers and the freelancer told me to get them off his back or he'd fail to deliver and cancel the contract. This is all on their system and records, so they see this going on, yet never intervene to assist. Now I am a full year into it and still haven't seen ONE single thing, so for the THIRD time I sent them emails outside of Upwork now, because the freelancer ceased to communicate on their system. They deactivated his account and told me they can't do anything to get the freelancer to complete the work because they are ""just a technology company, similar to eBay"". Always creating excuses and never helping. My business is completely destroyed bc of the negligence of the platform and their support. It also says this freelancer had completed 100% of the work which is false, so actually knowing the quality of the freelancer is completely unknown. The fact they allow freelancers to cancel and block a hiring person without cause is completely fraudulent. I am thousands of dollars in the hole and more importantly, I've wasted two years of my life dealing with situations completely avoidable if there were proper screenings and limited ability for freelancers to control the relationship in the way they do. They empower scammers to do this same thing over and over again.

Hello everyone,I need help with a little problem. We have a project that is paid between two companies. During 2020 the payment to the freelancer was made by company A and during 2021 the payment we need to it will make by company B. The problem is that, with Christmas, we made a mistake and the invoice for the week of December 28 to January 3 was invoiced to company A, instead of B. We have the option of making a dispute to bring the money to company A and then pay the freelancer for the week with company B, instead of moving the invoice from one company to another which will be chaos for the financial departments.  Taking this into account, we do NOT want to affect the reputation of the freelancer, so ¿it is possible to make a dispute, recover the money for company A, generate a new job for the freelancer with company B and pay the hours of 2021 plus the week 28-03 without affecting the reputation of the freelance? At the end, the freelancer did a great job and we don't want to create any problems and Upwork will earn the same amount but it will be easier for us to have all the invoices in order. Thanks for your time

	Is manual time annoying to the clients?
","Jan 6, 2021  04:20:18 AM","
In hourly contracts, I sometimes take breaks and forget to open the time tracker. So, I add them as a manual time. based on your experience in Upwork, is manual time annoying to the clients?what I mean by annoying is not that the client will raise a dispute or will give you bad feedback, although this might happens, I mean at least he will have doubts about your honesty, feel a bit uncomfortable, and will not be your long-term clients.I have been working on Upwork for 9 months and I am still learning how to use this tracker. I have recently known that tracker counts a minute logged as a 10-minute segment with low activity (1 from 10) & you should be above 5 in the activity level, such things the I have not considered before and  the clients didn't complain about but that doesn't mean they are satisfied and comfortable & that's why my 100% JSS mainly came from fixed-price contracts, not hourly contracts

	Dispute with a freelancer for leaving my job incomplete
","Jan 4, 2021  09:02:40 PM","
I got in touch with one freelancer, and she left my job in partial completion. She took away my money without properly informing me about her departure. When I claimed a refund, she has not refunded my amount, rather she has blocked my access to the research report which she sent across to me intentionally. In the dispute redressal forum, one Mr. Floyd was appointed to look into the matter. Now, she is also keeping quite. Ultimately I have lost both ways. Please suggest what to do now?Regards,Arijit Das

	Refund the money for premium post
","Jan 2, 2021  11:35:59 PM","
How to get a refund of money of the premium job post? I don't understand English well and for the first time here. I published a work and invited freelancers, but nothing was displayed for me and a strange window constantly popped up. I thought I hadn't finished making out my post, when I clicked next my money was debited. I want to return them, I wrote in support, but they do not answer me. You act like scammers by constantly showing a banner and people don't understand what's going on. I deleted the published work, but the money was not returned. I'm ready to give up your service forever, but give me back the money. I didn't get the service, I didn't find a freelancer and I don't need it anymore. I do not want to use your service. Just give your money back and don't act like a scam

	Poor quality work
","Dec 29, 2020  03:57:55 AM","
This has become the norm at Upwork, allowing sub-par quality work from  **Edited for Community Guidelines** and then no consequences for the contractor, and Upwork pretty much wash their hands too, leaving the client holding the bag. All the while, Upwork double-dips on your fees and they charge the contractor fees. If you don't get good work, doesn't matter to them, they just got paid. Anyone else thinks this is nothing but a  **Edited for Community Guidelines**? Because it is. I used to be a fan of Odesk a long time ago before they became Upwork, the quality was so much better and the people were more honest. Upwork just protected themselves with a bunch of legal-ese terms and conditions including their ""self-paid"" arbitration process where guess what? You pay them again to help arbitrate a crappy setup and framework in the first place.
 
If I put out a job, I get 4 out of 5 low-quality contractors, overselling their capabilities, charging x USD per hour knowing the cost of living in their cities/countries are pennies compared to the U.S. They get to deliver  **Edited for Community Guidelines** work while Upwork just steps back to collect and count their sneaky-earned cold hard cash.

	Understanding Time Tracker Activity Levels
","Jan 2, 2021  03:49:39 PM","
Hi.  I've been an Upwork client since 2013.  I currently have contracts with 16 freelancers on long-term hourly contracts (with all time tracked through the Upwork time tracker app).... however, I have no real idea how to interpret the ""activity levels"" shown on my freelancer's Work Diaries.  The official Help page on this topic doesn't really tell me what a reasonable / average level of actiity is for a given type of activity... so, as a client only, I don't have any real idea much activity I should expect to see from my freelancer work diaries.  (All of my freelancers are doing online customer support work, no phone calls or offline work tasks at all, although they do sometimes have to read longer emails or watch 10-minute videos)Is there a way I can test the Time Tracker app myself (without being a freelancer or having to hire myself) so that I can do the same work as my freelancers do for an hour or two, and compare my own activity levels with my freelancer work diaries?  This would give me a benchmark to compare my own activity levels with what my freelancers typically log. If this isn't possible, can anyone share some guidance on what to expect for activity levels from my contractors?  As mentioned, they have no offline work tasks at all, their entire workday is spent handling customer support emails/tickets/tech support/social media.  Should I be seeing activity levels above 7-8 out of 10 consistently for this type of work, or is it normal for them to be logging activity levels below 3 or 4 out of 10 frequently?Thanks in advance.

	Testing multiple freelancers for one job
","Sep 7, 2015  08:17:08 AM","
Hi, I've done a bit of reading on this forum and I believe I have a better understanding of how I should approach this. But to be safe, I want to run my thoughts before the community before I proceed: I have a graphic design project in which I've received many applications, but only a handful I'd consider. Of that handful, I'd like to see each of their initial concepts before deciding who gets to take the project to completion. My understanding is that it is a bad idea to ask these freelancers to present their concepts to me without any pay. Not only is it unethical (obviously) but it negatively impacts their rating. Do I have this right? This is a fixed-price project so my understanding is that I set up the milestones within the job -- their frquency, how much each pays, etc. Do I have this right? My thought is to hire them all with the first milestone as a submission of their initial concept. They would all be paid for those submissions -- maybe 15%-20% of the total job fee. From there, I would chose the one whoose concept most closely matches my vision and continue work with only that person. If for some reason I still had trouble deciding, I could potentially have a second milestone set up as some additional concepts or a revision of the initial concept, etc. Anyone I took to the 2nd milestone would be paid accordingly, of course. The important this is, I would communicate this process to them when I offer them the job so they would be under the full understanding of how I am approaching this. Does this method seem viable? Ethical? The right way to approach it? One last thing: This is more of a technical question...Rather than send them each a message about this process then await their response before I hire them, can I just click the ""Hire"" button for each of these freelancers, explain the process above, and if they don't like it they don't have to accept the job? If you can't tell, this is my first job posting here, so I'm not sure how the process works. Thanks so much for your time!

	freelancer ran free with a contract...
","Dec 30, 2020  06:19:41 AM","
I contracted a freelancer I worked with previously, and asked him to do 8 hours research on a topic, and 10 hours of setup for an ongoing project. His rate is $10/hour and after the research project is finished he did a few hours of work on the setup of the bigger part of the project. I had been distracted, saw there was a hold on a $70 charge for the freelancer, and busy, so I released it to him and forgot abou **bleep**. He is then supposed to wait for a video from me on how to proceed. I was shocked to find a $1000 charge later. We agreed on 18 hours of work, but maybe I messed up the contract setting; or when I released that $70 it automatically continued the contract. Anyways, he submitted the work he had done, it was completely wrong, 100% worthless data, and the entire workload he submitted is less than 5 hours of work,. I replicated what he had done, with zero setup, and am positive there is no way he spent even close to this much time on the task, which was done absolutely incorrectly. The project was to start reserach and layout a structure before beginning. I am not sure how, but the contract resumed and I was fleeced on the hours. I have been contacting upwork from the start, and they have been less than helpful. My current dispute I had not heard a response back for several days, and come to check now, and it is missing. This is a lot of money to me, and money I cannot afford to let me stolen. Why does upwork not help in this situation? I did respond straight away as soon as I saw something was off; but I did not realize we had to micromanage every seocnd of the freelancer, or be at risk. Is there any chance of upwork making things right, or will I have to eat the loss for a second time, delete my account here, post publicly in every forum I can think of, and warn all personal friends who ever consider hiring a freelancer to avoid upwork? Is a good resolution possible?

	Hired someone to build an android app, do I own source code?
","Dec 31, 2020  05:51:07 AM","
I hired a freelancer to build an android app, but as I'm new here, and I've never hired a developer before, I supposed the source code was part of the deliverable.As we are going to the final part of the job, as asked him about the source code, but he says the source code is not part of the deliverable, because this was not mentioned on the job scope.If I hire someone to buy a house, at the end of the project, I want the keys to it. In a similar fashion, if I pay someone to develop an app for me, I would expect to have the source code upon completion.The reason for this is that hiring him I'm buying his time to write source code. Usually if someone only gets the application and NOT the source code, they are buying a license to use the software, which is essentially what he's doing giving me the executable, but retaining all the source code.""An employee who writes an article, designs a web page, creates a computer program, or draws an illustration for a company publication is creating a work for hire. Even if the artist is not technically an employee, if a court determines an employment relationship exists between the artist and the employer, the artist will not own the copyright on his or her work. If an employee creates a work on his own time, it probably is not work for hire, even if the employee uses it on the job.""What should I do about this?

	How Does One Contact Support
","Jun 12, 2020  10:29:28 AM","
I just completed my first project in record time. I was so pleased until I actually tried to pay the freelancer and all of a sudden the Upwork dashboard is a mess of things. Is it actually possible to contact support directly? Searching through the Upwork website is basically an infinite loop that pushes you to the community. The FAQ page doesn't work. I tried to access the FAQ section I am interested in and the details briefly display and then I am redirected to the main FAQ section so I can keep trying the same thing over and over. When using the chat function possible resolution articles are offered. I am then asked if this resolved my issue and the only possible option is for me to select a yes so I suppose it means I don't have an issue. There is no place to actually contact the help desk. I want to pay my freelancer now but there is no way for me to complete the payment now. WTF?

	Ambiguous question by Upwork
","Dec 14, 2020  02:46:17 AM","
A Bosnian translator I recently hired, did a great job. I gave him 5-stars, as he deserves.Upwork also asked me: ‘How likely are you to recommend this freelancer to a friend or colleague?’ Well, I never encounter anyone needing a Bosnian translation, so that is unlikely. Let’s be honest, Bosnia might be beautiful, but the country is small.A week later, the translator informed me that his 100% approval rating lowered to 98%, and this would hurt his business. Apparently, my answer to the recommendation question was to blame, as Upwork falsely assumes now I am unhappy with his work.Could Upwork correct this, and remove the ambiguous recommendation question on the website altogether? Freelancers with ‘obscure’ specialities need to be rated according to their qualities.

I completed a job with my freelancer who did an ok job, but I never understood why the login screen was the first screen in the app. Then I verified the functionality of the app, and it was fully functional except for that annoying logjn screen. I never asked the freelancer to fix it, and he indicated that people needed to sign in so they could get updates for what they had scanned. Then we gave the freelancer the OK to job completion. Then about two weeks later I submitted the app to the appstore, and then got a rejection. The rejection said that the app needed to have users try out all the features of the app, this was one of three rejections. Then I told my freelancer and then he's like it will be $400 to design the new logic. Im like if you had done the logic right the first time it wouldn't need to be redesigned. So now i got a $1000 app which is useless, it cant be uploaded to any appstore. Is there a wa¥ i can have a arbitration after the contract is closed?

	Beware of Freelancer *edited* - DO NOT HIRE
","Dec 22, 2020  05:40:33 PM","

**edited for Community Guidelines** is a scam, buyer beware. **edited for Community Guidelines** made a proposal for the work I needed done for my Android App. His proposal was made after he reviewed all files and a physical device. **edited for Community Guidelines** said he would do the work for 40 hours. I agreed. He then charged the full 40 hours ($1000). Over the next month or so **edited for Community Guidelines** charged me small amounts totaling nearly double the agreed amount ($1962). **edited for Community Guidelines** has never delivered any of the deliverables in his own proposal. The only thing I ever received was a screen shot. I ended the contract after  asking him to honor his proposed work that has been double paid for or refund the money paid. He said he would refund the money if I didn't leave negative feedback. I did not want to do that but again gave him what he wanted and left the 4 stars and no commentary. After I ended the contract he was able to charge me ANOTHER 11 hours of work for no work done. I disputed the charge and he rejected the dispute saying he is not willing to refund disputed amount claiming he did the work. To date has not refunded my money as he promised several times. I did reach out to UpWork but they did not get a response from **edited for Community Guidelines** so they did nothing. BUYER BEWARE - HE WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY, DO NOTHING AND NEVER REFUND YOUR MONEY AS PROMISED. He clearly knows the UpWork system well enough to get around all of the safety nets for the Client.  UpWork does more to protect the Freelancer who scammed me rather than me the Client who is out a lot of money.

I had to Google this first and I am truly upset. So first you can purchase Upwork Reviews: 
 **Edited for Community Guidelines** 
 
I use Upwork frequently. I trust Upwork's vetting process for candidates and always filter for highest reviews prior to hiring a candidate.
 
In the past month, I've hired 3 WordPress ""experts"" with no clue how to do basic layout tasks.
 
I've hired not 1 but 2 SEO ""experts"" (and now working with a third) who assumed I wouldn't make a backup of my site before his work later to find out that when his work was done, the code was 100% identical as before with no change in modified date on the file (directly on the serer).
 
Both of these candidates were 5 star candidates according to Upwork.

	Freelancer profile ""no longer available"" help.
","Mar 13, 2020  04:13:57 PM","
I posted a job that a freelancer turned in and I marked it as complete. Overall it was mostly within what I was asking, and I'm not mad at him missing one part of it. I also didn't catch it during testing. It was a programming project, so these things happen. I tried to contact him, and his profile says ""this profile is no longer available."" Should I request a refund from the contracts panel, or is there a better way to approach this? If their account is suspended, are they still able to answer replies and log into their account? I'd rather not go and ruin someone's profile with a refund request, if there is some misunderstanding and he's getting it resolved.

	close dispute period early
","Dec 22, 2020  04:37:17 AM","
Dear Upwork Client Community, I hired a freelancer for a week, on hourly contract. The job was temporary, the contract is now ended, I am very satisfied with his work. The money for hours was deducted from my bank account this Monday (12/21/20) and I received a message from Upwork that I have until Friday to dispute. If I don't have any disputes, the freelancer will get paid next week. I like this system, it offers clients a safety cushion. However, what if I don't have any disputes and I was extremely satisfied with the freelancer who worked for me recently. In addition, I know that the guy I worked with is having financial problems and could use the money before Christmas, instead of next week... Can I waive my right to dispute, or indicate that I am satisfied so that he gets paid faster?  (FYI: He is not top rated, so this won't work for him: https://support.upwork.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047676133-2020-05-04-Faster-Payouts-on-Upwork- ) Thank you,Tamas

Upwork needs to add a way to archive or delete messages, it's innefficient to work around old jobs and messages.

	How to delete the entire hiring, canceling hire, and rating process for one freelancer?
","Dec 15, 2020  04:09:55 AM","
I hired a freelancer and then almost immediately canceled the hire. At this point I found I had to leave a rating for the freelancer. Because the experience was not positive I left a 6 out of 10 rating. I felt the freelancer was ""lowballing"" me - agreeing to do the work, but to bill me at a much higher rate than the posted job fee.I did not see any way to simply cancel the hire without leaving a rating.Now the freelancer is concerned about the negative rating and wants to do the job at the posted rate, but I'd prefer not to work with him at all. The ideal solution to me, since I am partly responsible for not asking screening question early about whether he was willing to accept the compensation or not, is to simply erase the entire hire and cancel experience from the Upwork records.Can we do this?

Hi. i have been scammed in upwork. from a chinese developer. he gave to developers two tasks. I am new and dont understand about development of softwear much, BUt i do know about the money a little.  I also have very little knowledge about upwork client account payment policy. The developer is telling me that upwork will pay the hired freelancer when job is done and I don't need to  pay now. I dont understand how they will get paid. Why and how upwork is paying them after end of contract? Here as a employer , I jsut got invoice. I have pay those bill to upwork if upwork pays. How upwork is making sure that i am paying? He is trying to end contract this morning with those freelancer developer hired through my account. I didnt let him do that. I said let me check on the payment process of upwork first. One thing i am sure that i have to pay the due bill of invoice from upwork. But how if i dont have money in my account? He was telling that after this contract end upwork will pay the freelancer who worked for me and he will deliver that softwear to original owner and get paid, then he will pay me. what is the upwork's payment policy for short? please don't refer me to payment policy tab cause i already checked and didnt get my answer. There's two developers named
**Edited for community guidelines**are currently working now. Their account looks legitimate and older. Even they are connected with some other softwear group and one admin from that group is also connected in that job contract. 
 
I am sorry that i didnt inform this, now he is totally suspicious and acting rude but not understanding. I need help to catch this fraud if any. 
 
Please if you think i have done wrong let me go for this time, Its been a lesson to learn. I am new here and like many i fell into somekind of trap. please dont take any action against me for this time. Help me to solve this trouble. Please help me how can i get money safely from that chonese developer.

	Developer Dropped work at 95% Progress and Stopped Replying Messages

Hi UW Community.
 
I´m facing the following problem. I hired a developer (**Edited for Community Guidelines**) -Top Rated- to complete an app upgrade project which was already started. I spent around 3,000 USD makign app upgrades with him. Suddenly at the very last phase before making changes Live he just stopped replying my messages. As simple as that. He is just not replyng anymore to my messages even as he shows online he is not even messaging me for anything.Its been a while since he started making excuses of all kind (he got married, his brother is sick, vacations, etc etc) so, I´m here after probably 2-3 months of this guy playing with me, my money, my project, my time and my expectations about Upwork. I do have the work in my Git repository but work was not completed and the worst thing is the total 0 communications from his part either to tell me he cannot do the work or he doesnt want to do the work.
 
I ask experienced UW Clients:
- what do you guys do in this situation ? Of course I would have to go and hire another develoepr but... this totally sucks. I will have to spend hours for next guy to get to to speed.I ask Upwork Staff- How can we punish this behavior ? This is totally unprofessional and makes Upwork looks not as serious as it is supposed to be.I have worked multiple projects in UW and this is not the second time this happens to me. Total waste of my time and money.Appreciate only well intentioned responses.Thanks

Hello, I am new to upwork. I had a project going on with a developer that i selected because Upwork marked him as a rising talent. Firstly he was too slow to deliver anything. I somehow managed to get him to reach the first milestone. I also gave him a bonus out of my own pocket. Later he started being even slower and one day he says  "" can stop here"". I made it clear to him that the project was one single piece. Leaving it unfinished is like not starting it at all. I even agreed to pay him more for the second milestone.  He started stating personal reasons such as cant pay rent etc etc. then one day onwards he totally dropped out and stopped responding. I have never seen such unprofessional behaviour from a so-called ""Rising Talent"". what are my optiosn at thsi point? Please guide me.

	Identity theft and hiring, beware - tips on how to avoid
","Dec 5, 2019  10:54:53 AM","
This pertains to technical hires. There are a number of really fantastic technical contractors on UpWork, unfortunately, I'm encountering quite a few that are running scams. It used to take me a long time to figure out who was legit and who was not. Now it usually takes me 5 to 10 minutes because most people give themselves away quickly. Here is what they appear to do: 1) The grab someone's LinkedIn image and profile information and create a fake account on UpWork (so same name, image, background). Usually, the LinkedIn profile has a strong and varied tech background so they appear legit and they also fit many types of positions (app dev, web dev, Dev Ops, etc.)2) They apply for a job using the fake profile - sometimes tangentially related to the work. For example, if we are looking for a DevOps person they will apply with a general developer fake profile.3) They may even have some paid positions. I'm pretty sure those are fake employer accounts.So, before you realize you are being scammed, you think, ""wow, this person is awesome, can't wait to talk to them""Here are key tips that should raise flags immediately during initial contact:1) They ask to see your private repo/code. I'm not sure who would fall for that, but it's a clue that they are not legit. If anyone's asking to get access to any proprietary information, simply move on.  2) During text chatting, ask open-ended questions.  Like what are the pros and cons of Kubernetes (or pick your favorite technical need). They will not be able to respond or they will take your request, Google it, and paste answer. It's easy to spot this - just google their result and you will see if copied verbatim. 3) Follow UpWork best practices - make all your communication via UpWork. If they ask to move chats to WeChat or mobile text or something else it's a scam. You can do all your communication on UpWork - do it - it's for your own safety. If they won't communicate on UpWork you are probably being scammed. Don't buy the ""I'm having connectivity problems, video/audio chat on UpWork doesn't work for me. blah, blah, blah"" . [EDIT: I've seen a number of comments from people that say that they have had trouble with UpWork's quality of video/audio chats - if that's true for you, do insist on a video call - see below. The downside of using outside communication is not having a digital paper trail. My suggestion would be to record the video chat but make sure you inform the applicant and get their permission.]4) Insist on a video chat for your interviews after the initial screening. If they are scamming you, they cannot do that because their face won't match their profile. I hope that helps.

Hi, we've used upwork for a couple of years but now we're increasing its use. This is why we decide to upgrade to plus account also for having more control on reports and costs. One of our main goals is to have a cost report by project. We have project with both fixed-prices than hourly prices contract on it. We'd like to have opportunity to have a report in which i can have list of all costs spent by that project. We'll take a look at Activites Tag but we found they're not the right tool. We needs something similar. A way to attach a ""Project Tag"" to both fixed prices than hourly contract (also if contract are closed !) so we can ask a report of costs by project. We take a look to do it manually : taking Report --> Time by Activities. Choosing right contract and settings calendar from starting of that project. This is the hourly contract part. Then we have to sum at this fixed price contract taken from Report --> transaction --> Fixed-prices and extracting from CSV the right contract with invoice type. It seems (and it is) a long way to do our report. There is some easy way to do that ? Hope someone can help us. Best Regards.

A client of mine signed up for Upwork at my request. To collaborate together. Can we count on a discount in commission?

This is my last contract.

	Opening my PC via a message sent to a Freelancer.
","May 13, 2020  08:49:43 PM","
Sorry If this description doesn't make sense. I'll try to articulate so that it does. I sent a job to a Freelancer with the excel link, thinking when they opened the link it would only open the excel work book. When I checked the nessage link to see if it worked, the link actually opened my PC - desk top where the Excel work book was saved. This meant the freelancer had acess to all documents etc. I have been trying to delete the link from the message to no avail.I have deleted the excel work book from the PC, but the link in the message still opens my PC where all my documents are. The freelancer never responded to my job offer so I cancelled the job, but the message is still there with the link.  I assume the message and link are visibile to the freelancer even though the job offer has been withdrawn. How do I remove the job offer from messages or the excel link in the message please? Thanks everyone!

The person who was the owner of our client account has left the company a while ago. At the moment, we need to change the payment details.

	How does Upwork vet freelancers and stop fake accounts?
","Dec 10, 2020  11:59:02 AM","
This problem used to be a nuisance, but now it's beginning to have an effect on our business.In the past week I've interviewed 7 people -- all of them had names and profile pics that were completely detached from the person I was talking to.It used to be something that happened 1 out of 5 times. Now, I can't seemt to get a conversation with someone who is the person they say they are.I don't have problems hiring people from different countries -- but I do have problems with hiring people who are clearly lying in their profile.I'm also concerned about reporting these fake accounts because if these freelancers are as skilled as they claim to be, I'm concerned that reporting them will result in vindictive behavior. We don't have time to be messing around with fake freelancers. We have deadlines to meet, and need to be hiring as efficiently as possible.What is Upwork doing to guarantee that the freelancers are who they say are? Vetting procedures could be implemented. If Upwork can't demonstrate that this is something they're actively combating, it won't be worth it to work with Upwork anymore -- and that would genuinely be a shame because Upwork is very useful, when it works out.

	problem? solve here (no FTC, BBC, FBI, PD, etc.)
","Dec 12, 2019  10:01:24 AM","
Occasionally in the Forum I see posts from clients who have had a frustrating experience, and they come here locked and loaded with a description of their problem and threats that they will go to ""Agency X"". Or maybe they claim they have already contacted ""Agency X."" I don't represent Upwork in any way, but I had some thoughts on the subject: I am posting this post in a brand new thread so that it is not associated with any single individual or situation. This is not a reference to any one Upwork user or situation. This post is intended to have helpful information about the general concept. It is not helpful if your first post in the Forum contains threats. It is better to ask questions. The truth is, threats are unnecessary. And not helpful. They could even be counterproductive. The participants in the Forum are very helpful. They include clients, freelancers, and moderators who are employed by Upwork itself. They will probably be able to answer your questions and help you out. Upwork wants clients to LIKE using this site. It wants clients to return and use the site again and again. It wants clients to be highly satisfied with their experience here. You don't need to threaten to go outside Upwork. And even if you do so, it is probably just going to be a waste of your time. There may be rare circumstances in which there is some merit or utility to such a concept. But usually: Not.Let's discuss some of the actual agencies or organizations some Upwork users have invoked. But the basic idea (spoiler alert) is this: They're not interested in your complaints about Upwork. FTC: The Federal Trade Commission is charged with protecting Americans against unfair trade practices. They do indeed deal with scammers and fraudulent companies. Upwork is neither. They are not going to do anything. BBB: The Better Business Bureau independently tracks businesses and complaints against them. Upwork has an A+ rating with the BBC. Your complaint is not going to change that. The BBB provides information to people. It does not force companies to return money to people if they have a complaint about the company. FBI: Yes, it is possible to ""report suspected scams"" to the FBI. But Upwork is not a scam. And the FBI is not the ""Internet Police."" The FBI has things they are interested in investigating, and that means criminal investigations. If you hire a freelancer to write a blog and it has spelling errors in it, that's not a crime. The FBI is not going to go after Upwork. Upwork has a pack of lawyers who make sure the contracts you enter into indemnify them from criminal liability. Your local police department (""PD""): Similar to the FBI. If your physical home (which exists in your local police department's jurisdition) is broken into, then yes you should call the police. Complaint about a freelancer in some other country that you hired through a website that is headquartered in Santa Clara, California? No, they are not going to do anything about it. Even if it is your next door neighbor, don't call the police. You hired somebody in your own town to do freelance work for you, and the freelancer failed to live up to your expectations? That is not a crime police will spend time on. They will tell you that it is a civil matter. None of this means that you don't have any recourse. If you have a problem, talk to Upwork. Feel free to talk to Customer Service. For MOST questions or problems, it won't hurt to do a search in the Community Forum first. Read what other people have experienced that is similar to your situation. It won't hurt to post questions in the Forum. You won't want to name people by name, but you can provide enough details that we can discuss the situation with you in a productive manner. If you have a problem with a freelancer, of course the first person to talk to is that freelancer. If you can't solve your problem that way, feel free to discuss the problem here. It is free to do so.

	Client feedback if Freelancer closes the job
","Dec 6, 2020  12:35:20 PM","
Hi, I have already read various answers regarding this.  I closed a contract after asking the client 2x to close it and they told me they would leave feedback but did not.  --I don't think it is practical to ""never"" close a contract myself forcing the client to then leave feedback. --The client apparently has 14 days to leave feedback after the job is closed but no client is going to remember to go back in the system and do that.   Since I cannot see what a client see when a contract is closed, I have no way of knowing if the client purposely did not leave it or because the Upwork system is not the most user friendly at times, did they just miss the screen/button to do it.  Can Upwork send a nice reminder to clients asking them to give freelancers feedback if they have not or attach it to the notification to the client?   Something like: "" Freelancer X closed your contract Y, would you like to leave the freelancer feedback? thanks,Michele

Hello, I'd appreciate any guidance to ensure both myself and my team use Upwork appropriately.  We're a small local business and have used Upwork successfully for a couple of small design items.  A great first experience.  However, I'm now considering hiring someone (and have actually posted the job) to help me conceptualize a brick and mortar business concept.  I'll need help in areas such as logo / identity as well as storefront design.  In short, I'm a busy business owner and do not want to make a mistep with ownership issues.  I obviously understand the payment part.  The client needs to pay.  But I want to make sure there's nothing more complicated than that.  Completely separate from Upwork, I learned a lesson in that regard when I bought a photo session for some friends who had just had a new baby.  I paid for the session and then they learned that every picture was a charge and their newborn was on the webpage of the photographer's site.  I respect people's work, but don't want to ever assume anything again, so any help here appreciated!

I can understand this in $20, $100, or $500 jobs, but my job is $3200, and 50% ($1600) is more than the total value of most of the jobs out there.Though he has high Upwork job success, this feels risky for me as a client.

	Bank account deducted but freelancer not paid
","Dec 1, 2020  04:36:57 PM","
Hi there, I have an issue I hope can be resolved quickly and efficiently. I've hired a freelancer to do some work this past month, starting Nov. 2, 2020, to finish out this week, Dec. 2, 2020. I'm paying her per week. She's great, no issues there, unfortunately, she didn't receive payment for Nov. 24, 2020, yet, Upwork has deducted my bank account the payment amount. In Upwork, it shows the milestone has not been completed. It has. I may have done something wrong inadvertently, but I'm not sure what. Per my bank account and Upwork's notification, I paid her on Nov. 2, 2020, Nov. 16, 2020, and Nov. 24, 2020. She didn't receive the Nov. 24th payment. She's currently due another payment. She and I are trying to figure this out, but I think it's best I ask here. For the record, we're fine with each other. We're just not sure what to do. I hope this makes sense. I appreciate your time and consideration of this matter. Best,Elda

	A new PayPal account problem? or management problem?
","Nov 29, 2020  09:55:06 PM","
I tried to replace my PayPal payment with a new one. It always pops error indicating the account is not verified. But the truth is this PayPal account is verified and paid somewhere else like Shopfiy, Yahoo, etc.So I contact the support, but had a terrible expereince with them. One of them just left the conversion without any useful informamtion, the other two keep asking me to verfiy the PayPal account with the outdated instrudctions. I hate the chatbot for providing useless information, but the human support did worse by providing wrong information and doesn't listen or understand you. I don't want to blame anyone of the support team, for I believe this is a management problem, if they could listen and observe the clients activitiies, it's not hard to find the struggling they have.BTW, even the chatbot the upwork using is outdated, there's many other better options.

A freelancer I asked to do some branding work took three logos from Freepik.com and passed them off as her own work. I caught her out and she ended the contract so unforuntely I am not even able to leave a negative review to warn overs. I've reported her but I doubt anything wiill happen and her top talent status will remain so it seems like she hasn't paid any consequences whilst I have delivered to a client 3 rip off logos which aren't even licensed to be used.

	Contractor Threatening with Leaving Me a Bad Review After Seeing My Review?
","Dec 1, 2020  12:32:44 AM","
I had a negative experience with a contractor. I posted about her before, but I decided to give her a second chance with more training and information despite the fact that she claims to be an expert. I've actually worked in the field for over a decade, but was looking for additional help. I didn't realize that the expert service that the contractor was touting wasn't true. Things unfortunately didn't work out and I ended up ending the contract, as the contractor was doing more harm than good, and I wrote an honest feedback with some examples of why I had to end the contract. I left out a lot of the bad. I did pay her for every hour that she claimed to work.  The contractor, however, isn't happy with the review. She left me a poor review I guess about not being available (despite the fact that she didn't show up for our meeting) and is now threatening to make it even worse if I don't change it? For changing it to a positive review, she will refund my money but I don't really care about that at all.  I'm just wondering if anyone has had experiences with this? This doesn't seem very honest at all. Is this something that I'm supposed to report?

	New to community and experience fraud twice
","Nov 27, 2020  12:51:15 AM","
I have recently joined the community and posted for a task. I came across 2 freelancers who took up my task. First person did not do anything and started asking to release the payment. He initially insisted on paying directly to his bank which I denied. No work done and he forced me to pay some token amount for the work. I did because I did not want to stuck my money to dispute. The same work then taken up by another freelancer. Deposited money to escrow and freelancer started to work. Now for past 2 days, the freelancer not even responding to my messages (despite being online). I took the name of the freelancer and tried to find them on linkedin. To my surprise, there seem to be completely diffrent profile. I think, both of the profiles I came acrorss are fake people and they are just doing fraud on this platform. I can provide their names and complete chat as proof.  Can Upwork staff look into the matter and stop this fraud on the platform?

	why would a client hire a freelancer of the platform ?
","Nov 25, 2020  04:50:51 AM","
Basically client will loose all the benefits and protection from upwork against your freelancers if client hire of the platform. Because some freelancers, they'd like to cheat, blackmail, or even just simply not doing a good job, etc. Client should prefer to hire in upwork because of the benefit and protection.Such as :- feedbacks stars is a guarantee of good work- take actions on criminal freelancers (blackmail, steals, etc)- More So I really don't understand, why would a client need to hire them directly especially knowing most of the freelancers are abroad ?What is client  benefit of having them of the platform ? I am asking, because I found this platform is many times being prejudice toward their clients of doing such things eventhough I don't see any associated benefit toward the clients of such action. On the other hand, I know the benefits for freelancers for getting hired externally, even though not as significant. Such as the 20% fee which eventually can be reduced overtime anyway. So clients would refuse any freelancers whom are asking to get paid directly, since there's always freelancers who'd be willingly to accept such fees.

	Anyone else working
","Nov 27, 2020  03:13:48 PM","
The name of the job is ""Video game testing and review"".Since their offer was put up, I received only one communication and it was for a file download link.
I downloaded the file, making sure I had my antivirus up to date beforehand, and it didn't work, so I wrote back to try and clarify the process.
Now, I don't want to be that guy who makes false accusations. I'm just saying that these steps I've followed would be a pretty inconspicuous way to distribute malware or virus by someone using this platform.
 
Again, not saying this is the case, but I've had no further communication with this client, so I'd like to ask if anyone else is on this contract since they were looking for a sizeable sample of testers.
 
Hope this is just a misunderstanding.

Is this feature somewhere on the roadmap? I'm talking about Markdown syntax similar to what you can use on StackExchange, Trello, Slack, etc.  It's 2019, and job descriptions must still be plain text... If we were talking about HTML in job descriptions, I'd understand the reluctance. But Markdown offers basic formatting with no security tradeoffs. And it can't break your layout. Your devs wouldn't even need to write a Markdown parser - there are tons of free, open source packages out there.

Hello, I hired a children's illustrator who has a very difficult time performing a simple sketch. He asked me to send him a reference of the type of art I want and instead of using his imagination, he draws the reference in full detail. The first milestone was to complete a cover page, what he sent me was not my vision on the page. I asked him to do digital instead if they would help with the illustrations. Instead of him sending the sketches immediately he texts me"" I doing your sketches will send soon"" that turns into a day and sometimes the next day with more text "" finishing up the sketches will send before the end of midnight. I am becoming more and more frustrated and would like to cancel the contract. What is the best way to do this?

	Client asks to remove negative feedback
","Nov 23, 2020  04:12:11 PM","
Hi there, to be honest, I feel terrible to take this into the forum. However, am seeking advice on what should I do in this situation.  In July/August I was working with the client on the logo and I usually build my project with a help of milestones. So the first drafts are the first milestone then feedback update is another milestone and final files are sent as a 3rd milestone.After the first milestone, the client changed their brief a little bit, but this happens, I took it into consideration and worked on the update. The second milestone was also approved. Then nothing seemed right to the client, so I broke my own rules and prepared 3rd proposal and 4th. And he just disappeared. While he was gone, I have checked the website and he was using the screenshot of the logo from my proposal. I wrote a few times, that it's in low quality and I would love to finalise the project, I was ready to even prepare another round of sketches if he wasn't happy with what I have worked on. But he ignored my messages.  After a while, I closed the contract, returned the amount from the escrow for the final milestone and wrote very truthful feedback, that the client disappeared and was using my work without actually having any rights to do so. As rights are transferred with the source file of the logo (in 3rd milestone).  Today, November 24, 3 months later he wrote to me, that he is very disappointed in my feedback and that this never happened with any freelancer he worked before. Told, he thinks it's bad that he paid X amount of money and didn't even receive final files and that he used the logos from proposal ""just as a trial to see which one looks best"" ... for 3 months. Now he took another logo from the proposal and changed it on the website as well. Frustrating, but let him be. Told me, that he doesn't want to get this situation to a dispute to Upwork, but he could have if he would be interested in a negative outcome. Which I think is ridiculous, as I believe Upwork would be on my side. (I want to believe so) Now he is asking me to remove the feedback, as he would want to end this project on a positive note. And that he had no ill intention to use the files on the website. I truly believe, the guy was busy and Covid, and something else could stop him from dropping me a message that he needs a few months to think. But what to do in my situation? I am booked till the end of the year and even if I wanted to get that finished ""positively"" I simply don't have the emotional capacity to finish this, as I think, it was disrespectful to me, my time and my work.  Sorry, it is a long read, but I would like to ask, what would you do? Should I remove the feedback and just step back? Or should I make a statement and leave the feedback as there is nothing untruthful there? Would love to hear some opinions...Thanks!

	Inappropriate Client Behavior and Multiple Unpaid Test Jobs
","Nov 22, 2020  06:42:14 AM","
Hi,
 
A client invited me to a job post and I reached out thinking that he had already made a quick or thorough background check on my profile. We talked and discussed my rate, and then after that he asked me to do a sample work even though I already showed him my portfolio. I complied but asked for it to be a paid test job. He then agreed but said they can only pay me half the rate that I initially asked (once hired). And as for the sample test, they can only pay half of the halved rate. Instead of agreeing to the proposed very low rate for the sample test, I told him I'd do it for free only if I get to choose the photo reference so that it would still be my artwork. After finishing the test, he wasn't very impressed, and then we continued to talk until he we decided to do another unpaid test. I did the sample test as clean and simple as I could, with which he responded with a not so satisfied feedback again. I asked how I can improve but he wasn't interested in pointing out why the style wasn't the same as theirs. Instead he asked for another test job. I told him I've had enough of it as I already did 2 for them and reminded him that asking for unpaid tests is a red flag for anyone.
 
I'm mad because he used an inappropriate language to comment on my sample work. That's why I'm writing now. I wanted to report him but I'm not sure how to do that. I need your help again guys.
 
Enclosed are the 2 sample tests I did, their style and a portion of our conversation.
 
Thanks!

	Freelancer - Leave Inappropriate Behavior on my Proposal, why?
","Nov 20, 2020  10:09:40 AM","
Hi, I was looking for graphic designers and submitted one job post along with my requirement. Few designers applied on the job post and I had explained to them my requirement via chat or zoom call. I also asked a few of them to provide one sample design so that I can pick the best designer as per my budget but 2 designers leave - ""inappropriate behaviour"" on my job proposal. Designer 1 case -  The designer has given me a sample image but somehow we did not agree on the price, so will this be count as - inappropriate behaviour"" of mine. Still, I offered almost doubles the rate as what other designers agreed to do the work for my project, but just I can't give the rate the designer wants can't put me in the category of - ""inappropriate behaviour"" of Client. When I cross-checked with a designer regarding the feedback submitted by her, The Designer said that she has not left any such feedback (so will it be automatically generated) Designer 2 case - We hardly did any communications but still designer has given ""inappropriate behaviour"", so will it be automatically generated message. I have never involved in any such type of activity (Inapprorpritae behaviour, etc) with any freelancer so how freelancers can leave such type of feedback on my job proposal. I really appreciate Upwork community members if they can address this issue ASAP. Freelancers can't leave negative feedback just because if the Client doesn't have enough budget to pay the rate which Freelancers wanted. (Due to of frustration, if freelancer leaves such negative feedback on clients proposal, then it sounds very unpleasant to me. I hope that Upwork community will look into this issue and come up with a better solution. Upwork is one of the best platforms for both Freelancers and Clients but anything which is not acceptable cant happens here. RegardsVivek

I'm hoping an Upwork Moderatory can help.  We've contracted with an Upwork freelancer and things were going well, he was responsive and seeminingly doing good work.  However, we are part way through the work and he has gone radio silent for two days after being responsive and interacting with my team multiple times per day. I've tried every, limited communication channel we have available to us but zero response of any kind.  We like him and would like to keep working with him but this is entirely unacceptable and unworkable.  Perhaps something acute and drastic/unfortunate has happened on his side but I have no clue either way. Here is the contract number,25396069

	Want to give a payment to a freelancer with no job open, my promise I won't be able to fulfill
","Nov 19, 2020  02:27:35 PM","
I am a client with an excellent history on upwork.  I had posted a job previously that had an applicant that I did not think was a good fit for that job, but said I was going to look for a good fit and create a small job for him as he is a good writer.  I have not been able to fulfill my promise of opening up a small job for him.  I promised a few times and thought I could start the job but now have other priorities.  I fully feel it my responsibility and would like to pay him (it is a somewhat small sum so I can easily do this) even though I did not open up a job and do not plan to in the near future.  I like to leave all partnerships showing I carried through on my own commitment--and if I was not able to do so like in this case, I would like to show that was on my own shoulders. Can anyone help to tell me the steps on how I can send through a payment to this freelancer without opening up a job? Thank you,Ann

	A freelancer has asked me to refund her as long I change my feedback to 5 stars
","Nov 18, 2020  11:21:58 PM","
Hi, 
 
I had a dispute. Upwork sent me an email telling me I lost the case....
 
Dispute Case for Contract ID# 25546647 (#30208027)
 
The freelancer was aware she didn't do her job so she was happy to refund me as long I change my feedback and give her 5 starts. i changed my feedback and she's just made the refund. 
 
Is that part of the ""resolution"" ? Or could I write my real review to her? 
 
Looking forward to hearing from Upwork colleges and what I should do now. Thanks!**Edited for Community Guidelines**

As an open-source project, we encourage contributions to our products and documentation, which we reward. If a contibutor is not on Upwork yet, we send an invite to organize our work using the platform and make secure payments, just like this case.  I appreciate any help on this matter from community or the Upwork staff.

	i'm a new client but I have a terrible experience with a freelancer
","Nov 17, 2020  04:57:06 AM","
Hello,  I'm a new client here. I've been so far having a great experiences with a few freelancers but there was a freelancer (contract ID 25546647) that didin't deliver the job properly and lied about getting the job done in time. Unfortunately being a new client, I thought I cancel the job and gave her $20 bonus but I've just realised I was charged $143.33 on top of that and now she doesn't want to refund any of the amount.  This experience has left me afraid that this could happen again and left me with a bad vibe on the jobs.  I'm waiting for Upwork to follow up the case and get back to me. I hope it can resolve ASAP as I""m having chat with other freelancers about other jobs and I""m not feeling secured to use this app.  Any advice on how people feel about similar situations? Thanks

	Upwork Falsely Suspend My account without any proofs
","Apr 2, 2020  10:50:57 PM","
hello
 
I want to ask anyones here, why do people still believes to put their money and time on upwork if they can suspends your account without any proofs as they frelly would ? Because I really don't  think I can rely on this platform as much as I used to.
 
Because what happens to me was, I was falsely accused asking and/or making payments outside the platform. I was very shocked, dissappointed, disgusted, and anggry about this false accusation because I firmly and clearly didn't break any such of a policy. It feels like, you were accused of murdering someone without any proof ?! yeah how does that fells ?!
 
Then I got anggry with their representative, BUT then beside making an apology to me they still insist to accuse me that I broke a policy and saying they can't disclose or give the proof as it's their policy ?! who will makes such a terrible policy ?! 
Honestly, I may have had uncociously broke 1 or 2 policy in the past , which I didn't know I what I did. BUT at that time they did shown the proof to me when and where I broke it. 
So I'm sure this time, they just CAN'T find nor have the PROOF at all what so ever !!
 
 
So let's make a policy of ourself, ""we can accuse anyone : murdering someone without must giving a proof nor disclosed the proof  ! 
THIS IS **edited for Community Guidelines**AND UNPROFFESSIONAL !
 
Why and how can you trust such a ridicolus platform ?!
 
 
Because I think what trully happen was, At one time, I was asking a freelancer to speak in skype beause I want to speak and say seomthing privately. [SPEAKING BY SKYPE IS ALLOWED BY UPWORK]. But the freelancer refused and said it's against upwork's policy. Well so I said, fine then, forget skype and let you continue working for us. But then the freelancer just refused my job offer because he thinks I broke a policy. Well I don't have any issue with him, until then the freelancer reported me. But the problem here is with upwork, not the freelancer, by actually ASUMING me asking a payment outside the platform for wants to say something privately in skype !.
 
Private does not means asking payment outside upwork,**edited for Community Guidelines**
Private can be password or something RIGHT ?! GET IT ?! OMG...
Nevertheless if it was because of that freelancer or not, that freelancer must show proof of his accusation firstly before actually suspending me ! but they didn't !
 
Well, If I was a FREELANCER  in this platform, I would be so much concern more if I were you if this could happens to you or probably already have. Then this feelings will hurts so much much much much more !. You worked hard for it, building up your CVs/feedbacks/etc here, then all of the sudden you were accused of something you didn't do and get suspended or banned ?!. 
I'm sure you all knows that this have had happens to a few or MANY times already to the past against freelancers, so the question again is ""WHY WOULD YOU TRUST/INVEST YOUR TIME/ENERGY IN THIS PLATFORM WITH SUCH A RISK?"".
Why don't you put effort in/invest more in another platform or just find another way besides online freelancing ?
 
 
Despite I've always pay upwork in their platform more than > $400-900/week then all the sudden they accused me paying outside upwork ?!
so the question is : 
 
WHY WOULD  I PAY OUTSIDE UPWORK ?!
WHAT'S THE BENEFIT FOR ME ?!
IT'S THE FREELANCER WHO GET CUT BY 5-20%, SO IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM !
I PAY WITH MY BUDGET AND DONT CARE ABOUT THE CUT AT ALL!
 
THIS IS DISGUSTING, RUBBISH, UNPROFESSIONAL, **edited for Community Guidelines**
Of course IM MADDDD !
 
I TRUSTED UPWORK, BUT TILL HOW THIS HAPPENED !
 
Because we have deadline, so suspending means we can't work and be productive and make money  ?!?! it's feels like upwork don't care if we die anyways as long as we always pays our money to them !
 
P.S
Upwork loves to delete what I ever we writes here as they freely wish, so If you'd like to speak with me directly u can reach my **edited for Community Guidelines** or skype. Because I really do wants to know what's in your head to trust this platform.

I have searched on upwork and I'm unable to locate request for refund. Freelancer admitted working on other people's hourly under my contract after my through investigation.  Freelancer was unable to deliver design and ux on time and continued delaying work on all 3 project.  He would also design exactly like reference app which would violate apples copycat policy.  Please advise whom I should contact in regards to terminate and getting refund.

	Cancelling Fixed-Price-Contract (prematurelly)
","Nov 9, 2020  12:36:56 AM","
Hello. I made a milestone with a freelancer, that he's going to learn some stuff for 5k per month. I changed my mind, bcz many other freelancers already know the stuff and want the cancel the milestone. He was learning for 4 days. I talked to him and he said milestone was set and mistake is on your side, so just give the whole 5k. Which I consider kind of greedy. Can I cancel the contract and pay only proportional sum of money (meaning 250 per day)? Thank you Robert

	Upwork is protecting fraudsters
","Nov 11, 2020  12:28:09 AM","
I have been scammed by a supposedly 'top-rated' freelancer who stole $1100 of my money and didn't do ANY of the work. I have proof that **Edited for Community Guidelines** didn't do any of the work and despite offering this proof many, many times it was completely ignored and I was offered just $3.10 as a refund for low activity in hours logged! I also have testimony from another freelancer who previously worked on my site that he didn't carry ANY of the work but this has also been ignored. Why are Upwork allowing fraudsters to carry out serious crimes at the expense of their clients?

	Marketing Strategist Expectations

Hello, I have been struggling with this issue. I have hired a marketing strategies who said they would deliver a market research document, a market strategy, and an implementation plan. So far, I have received the research document that only covers one aspect, which is the competitors and nothing else. I reached out and requested a more thorough one, i.e. markets, trends, etc. They came back with a second document where they just copied and pasted someone else's research. The market strategy they delivered only included different types of strategies without directly connecting the information with analysis and most of the information is copied and pasted from blogs online. When questioned about what I should expect from the implementation plan, they state that further research information and data analysis would be included, shouldn't this already be given in the first two deliverables? With the work thus far being subpar and mostly plagarized, can I refuse to pay for not meeting expectations or am I not being realistic?

Hi there, we have plenty of freelancers that we are working with and currently, they all belong to one team and one financial account. We would now love to get some better overview of the total invoices/milestones different units (or cost positions) have. I saw, that with teams, I cannot move the freelancers, so I have to rehire them to new teams, which is cumbersome but doable. Is there a way I can add existing contract to a new financial account?

However, I cannot figure out where this is specified in Upwork's Terms of Service or other legal docs.

	Suspicious customer
","Nov 6, 2020  03:25:54 AM","
One situation is really unclear to me.
There is one client on the upwork. He is from Estonia and posts a lot of tasks every day.All his tasks are of the same type and sound something like this:
**Edited for Community Guidelines**
The content and title changes slightly from time to time, but in general the meaning is the same.
The budget is almost always ~ $ 750 and requires 6 connections.Ulually, even often, on his jobs 50+ proposals, and never several interviews. Always just one interview and then hire.
If you look at the guys who receive these tasks (you can easily do this by looking his previous contrats), you will notice that they are all connected by the fact that they are from the same region of Ukraine and the fact that they have the same photos in their portfolio and their portfolio is connected with the **Edited for Community Guidelines** website. Nothing more to say on this. There is an obvious link between all of them who work with this client.
At the same time, thay are selected again and again over the time, just them and nobody else, exept new only created accounts, which did not even have a single completed work before. And all their portfolio again has a link with**Edited for Community Guidelines** and Ukraine.
Large-scale jobs are completed in a couple of days or even less.
The customer does not bother to write about the time requirements and, in general, about the type of work, since it seems that he is simply pumping money into these accounts of the performers.
I am writing all those thing for you to know that the situation is very suspicious. But, first of all, freelancers like me are spending a 6 connects every day on every his job with no hope and spend the time writing proposals, where they obviously won't even be watched.Can you do something with that? If the client is really working there with these guys from fixthephoto, can you ask him to write personal invitations at least. Because but for such vacancies, work feed becoming a trash can where you are trying to find something at least normal, connections are wasted and time is wasted as well.
Example of recently published work by this client..

						Hello!I've been working with a freelancer since January 2020 to develop mobile apps.When we started, he said he would finish the project by March. But because of different reasons and excuses, he delayed the project until now, November, 2020 by working on it little by little.My mistake was that i never set deadlines and paid already 4/5 of the project. Bcs he asked he would tell me deadlines himself and he didn't.I argued about it several times but he kept showing me a little progress each time to keep me relieved.Now, if I argue him about the delay of the project, he says ""developers aren't available "" or ""we have done several new things that were not in the initial contract "" and etc.It's so annoying that they're working on some other projects and dont care about completing my project.No I can't do anything to push them. I'm technically dependent on them. And they know it!the app is complete 90%.But they're not trying to complete it fully which worries me a lot.Pls give some advice what to do.Thanks

	Question About Poor Quality of Work and Suspected Time Fraud
","Nov 4, 2020  09:15:42 AM","
Hi there, I've recently hired some freelancers for some projects that I've been working on. I have two questions regarding two different freelancers and was wondering whether anyone else could give me some insight on how they would proceed with the issue. 1) I am satisfied with the work that one of the freelancers did on my site. They are saying that it took them 12 hours to complete the job, but on my end, it says that they were only on the site for about 2 hours or so. My understanding is that they can have only made the changes necessary to my site if they signed in. On top of that, their communications with me didn't even take 12 hours. And on second look, they billed me for a day that they didn't even start work yet. I'm wondering if this is normal and whether anyone else has faced this before? I would have been happy to pay that as a bonus if they had negotiated with me, but this has left a rather bad taste in my mouth. 2)  I am completely unsatisfied with work that one of the experts have completed and there's no way that it's acceptable based on their profile and listed expertise. How do I go about paying her if my understanding is they are going to charge me for 15 hours for work that is completely unusable? Should I just take the loss and end my contract with her? I haven't used Upwork before and I was under the assumption that I was hiring an expert. I'm not really sure how to handle this situation.' Thanks in advance for any insight and advice!

Hi all,I hired a freelancer in May for three 70K books to be completed by the end of summer. She kept missing milestones and did offer discounts on the second book. She's a good writer and I wanted to work with her, but she just stopped turning things in. I only have 50K of the first book and despite repeated messages, she hasn't responded. I asked for a refund last week and heard nothing. Going by the dispute page, I should have come back Friday to file the dispute. So I asked for another refund (we did milestones, but I'm asking 1500.00 total on the last milestone). Is there anything else I can do? And will the page automatically show a dispute form/option, because right now, there's only a request for refund. Thanks!

","Nov 1, 2020  12:35:00 PM","
Okay so I'm really new to this. I'm working on getting a mobile app developed for both android and iPhone. I'm in talks with developers now.1) To clarify the milestones with a fixed price job, they're funded just one at a time? Because if I pay say 15,000 on the job overall (just a number, not an exact price), my bank won't allow that full amount at one time. It'll have to have permission at the very least or do it over days possible for fraud protection. So say if I do milestones of 1000 to 2000 at a time, it just comes out as that at a time to the escrow right? That's how I think I read it but I want to be sure.2) I just created an LLC, can I still use my personal paypal to pay or is that bad practice? 3) How do taxes work with this site? If I'm a client, I don't have to pay taxes right for spending money right? I mean I'm about 99% sure I don't but it has the id number so I'm just wanting to make sure.4) If the developer is oversea's how do the taxes work for them? 5) What's the best way to protect myself on this site from potential bad freelancers or the like? Not that I think it'll happen but I've kind of been seeing a lot of posts about it happening and it has me a little spooked..  edited to add:6) There is a NDA in the default settings of upworks ToS right? I saw that with another link in here? So do we need our own NDA? 7) All source material should go to the client at the end of the project right? Please answer if you're able even if it's only 1 or 2 questions of this...

Hi, I'd like to post a job, then discuss it with potentional sellers, then let them propose the fee.  I want to do this because I have zero experience in the field and don't know what's reasonable to offer.  If I offer too low, I may not get good sellers replying and if I offer too high, I've paid more than necessary.  I really don't know what amount is fair.   Can I do this?  Thanks.

	Attachment option is missing - New Milestone Version
","Jul 21, 2020  10:19:34 AM","
Since the new Milestones interface was released early July (relevant announcement) the option to attach files in milestones was removed. The workaround is to attach the necessary files in a separate message or include GoogleDrive/Dropbox/etc links in the description. But it's obvious that this is inefficient (we create around 50 milestones per month which all need an attachment) and secondly, it doesn't ""bind"" these attachments as part of the requested milestone. Please include this option back to the new version. Thank you!

	A fraud freelancer stole my money, provided evidence of her fool plays! How can I be refunded!
","Jun 15, 2019  04:26:24 PM","
So good people  I hired a freelancer to help me on a specific project. She misconvied me into being an expert, and she asked for hourly billing, of which I was fool to accept (believing upwork will be there whenever I needed help)! After she took $410 over the course of three months, I discovered upon our discussion that she was literally joking around with no work at all produced. Whenever I asked for update ""I'm working on it"", until boom: I found she was even talking about different topic.  I disputed, she rejected the dispute, the meditation came. The mediation employee asked her three times for proof of work, she literally provided a figure of her sending google links to me! She then claimed to have worked on a code that she claimed that she made it from scratch. When she uploaded it, I posted back with the original source of that code, that this scammer didn't even change a letter from it (Yep, it was a letter-by-letter, copy and paste code, even on different topic!).  After all, the employee told me that she cannot rule out in favor or anyone as mediation is about reaching mutual agreement, and that she cannot force the freelancer to reufnd the money at any case! WHAAAT! She has proof of fool play and lies in front of her eyes. That freelancer never even replied back to her continues request for proof of work. Now I'm being charged $410 for literally nothing.  Please help. What should I do!

	Difficulty with aggressive applicants
","Sep 13, 2016  08:19:12 AM","
Good morning everyone! I'm looking for some advice on how I might better interact with potential applicants. 
 
I've posted 3 jobs for my website **Edited for Community Guidelines** on Upwork, and all 3 times have been very uncomfortable. Even after saying in the posting that I do not want to be contacted outside of Upwork, I've been contacted via Skype (on my day-job handle, not my personal business handle), FB message through my blog's page, Linked In and emails.
 
Maybe most people don't experience this because it isn't as easy to find their contact info (mine's on my blog). But I find it beyond exhausting. 
 
Its not just the contact outside of Upwork either. Several (most even) applicants message me in Upwork asking for Skype info, or sensetive website info before we've even had a conversation about the problem/job. ""Send me Cpanel information and I can give time estimate"" or, ""Send Admin login and I will check this for you.""
 
It could be that most of my applicants are from other countries and cultures (in in the US), and many of these agressive applicants have very low rates. I'm not opposed to paying more, but these are the applicants my small 1 off jobs recieve. It adds a lot of junk to my plate, and frankly I think it is really disrespectful. I ignore all of those candidates but just doing that is time consuming (cross referencing names and Skype IDs etc).
 
My questions:
 
Is it always like this? Is this sort of agressive communication just the proce I pay for using a freelance work site?
 
If it isn't always like this, what can I do to improve my Upwork experience?

	Unresponsive Freelancer and Mediator for a complaint about fraudulent activity
","Oct 13, 2020  12:13:34 AM","
I hired a freelancer **Edited for Community Guidelines**. on an hourly contract to help trace a hack on our company. He claims it would take 40 - 100 hours and we begun the contract. He appeared to be doing some scanning of the IP addresses we gave me as suspected hack locations. However, after he loggin over 80 hours, he requested another 20 days, and I could tell from our chat that he was simply dragging on the hourly contract and scamming me for more hours. 
 
Initially, I believed him when he said the first 40 hours were for extensive scanning and so I approved the hourly invoice. However, in the chat conversation we were having afterwards, he told me he is just preparing to scan, which is why he is requesting 20 more days. He was self-contradicting and couldn't explain what he did in the first 40 hours of Work Diary logs. I have successfully disputed the second invoice of 40 hours but I am waiting for a mediator to handle the first invoice of 40 hours since I only discovered it was fraudulent after the reveiw period. 
 
I have contacted customer service many times and I have responded to the mediator many times but I still have not heard back from the Disputes Team. This is a serious matter as the freelancer was clearly committing fraud. The activity the freelancer logged was not what was assigned and he has been unresponsive after I discovered he was a scam. 
 
While I understand disputes take time, this case is a serious matter since the freelancer has committed fraud which is against Upwork's Terms of Service and therefore should not be protected under Hourly Payment Protection.
 
I would like some advice about how this case will be expedited to receive attention and how Upwork will address a dispute about fraud and not simply a dispute about quality of work.

	Fraud: How to request refund for closed contracts?
","Oct 23, 2020  06:17:04 AM","
Hi, world!We've contracted a translator who claimed he was a native Dutch & German speaker to translate 3 of our apps. We set several consequent contracts during the last 2 months and we were really happy to work with him. He was communicating in a little strange way (didn't know how to pronounce his name and sent me a Google Translator audio link), and also he said he could easily translate the apps in French. I didn't pay much attention to this moment as long as for one review I read on his profile. An angry client was complaining: ""... he doesn't have anything familiar with Dutch!"".We've implemented the translations and were very surprised when one day a client of ours has left a short but expressive remark: ""I don't know who translated your Dutch but it's a total f.... mess"". That was a real shock. We decided to hire independent translators here on Upwork to check the quality... and that was a complete disaster.Our 'native' Dutch speaker used to translate all his tasks with Google Translator - we've received documented evidence of that fraud. The same was stated either by French and German translators, here are their notes:1) ""the Dutch one has some translations that are unfortunate, because of the use of a translation machine""2) ""Dude sucks and uses Google Translate and doesn't even bother double-checking""3) ""It was definitely straight machine translation. The punctuation was completely missing. And in some instances, it was such an odd choice of words, so I plugged the sentence into a translator and that is exactly what came out.""I turned back to our 'friend' and messaged him, described the situation and offered to settle the things quietly, without appealing to Upwork administration. I requested refunds for all the contracts compromised. He just blocked me forever.Well, as for me, I don't think I would ever get refunded, but I feel I need to stop this scammer as long as he seems to continue to lie to other people and wasting their money. This case affects not only me as a client but ethics and the whole reputational system of Upwork as a service.What should I do? Is there any way to reach for support?

	Pakistan developers pretending to be in the US
","Oct 22, 2020  03:44:55 PM","
			
				
					
					
						I have not used Upwork in some time and this has now happened for the last 3 freelancers in a row I have interviewed and tried to hire. Is this a widespread problem on Upwork? Due to the nature of my projects and company policies, all work and data must be within the US and so must be the developers.It works like this: every time. I give them access to an empty VM to see if they can ssh into a Linux server, and send a meeting invite for an intro call for project kickoff.2 of the people had a long response delay in initially responding to emails, a day or 2. There is a delay in speaking on a conference call often too. One guy forgot to change his name on the meeting because I guess he couldn’t keep track of which Kevin or Thomas he was pretending to be.My meeting invite gets accepted and it says Pakistan Standard Time in the response’s timezone. You just told me that you and your employees if any were in TX, or CA, or pick any state. They explain that they have family in Pakistan and that a proxy on their laptop for calling them must be the reason. That has absolutely zero anything to do with your timezone setting in Gmail which has “upwork” or “developer” in the address and is clearly not your personal email address that you would use with family either. And Gmail isn’t on your laptop either.I ask for an IP address to allow through our firewalls. It’s always an AWS server to try not to reveal a location.Ny empty server is accessed. Guess what, the IP is located in Pakistan. Fired.I came back to Upwork to save time, not to waste it because people pretend to be someone they are not with exactly the same scam. If my projects are not for you then it is that simple. Move on. I am reconsidering Upwork. It seems to have the same problem as Elance.For anyone reading this who does this kind of crap, you are not nearly as smart and clever as you think you are. Not even close; just a liar.

	Refund was issued to me and I can't see credit on my account
","Oct 20, 2020  05:12:39 PM","
I had a job that was completed and I noticed there were a few errors.  I emailed the freelancer and he offered a $50 refund.  I accepted.  It seems to be reflected on the Milestones & Payments screen but I can not see the $50 credit and it was not refunded to my card.  I want to post another job but would like to apply the credit to the new job.  Where can I see it?  Any help would be appreciated.

	Ripped off by a fake agency: **
","Oct 20, 2020  08:03:47 AM","
I have contracted with this company called: **Edited for Community Guidelines** as they have provided me with a very professional contract, showing their expertise, what they have done in the past, and they do have senior developers, QA, and project managers.
 
Later on I have found out that is all scam, even their projects here are either faked or somehow altered. It was very painful contract, and now I want to request a refund for a milestone I have paid to show good faith, as I had a real intention to continue working with them and believed that can deliver.
 
I cannot find a way to ask for a refund in Upwork for fixed contract, only if I close contract and ask for the money in escrow. I want to first get my refund for the milestone, then ask for escrow. Any advice? If I close contract, that means I have paid them $1600 for zero delivery. I also understand that I made the mistake and trusted them more than should have been, but it is what it is and now need help.
 
Thanks,
Hosam

	Your Upwork account has been suspended
","Oct 20, 2020  04:50:44 AM","
Hello, I'm Alla. I have a laptop, the guy has a computer. We live together.
I registered myself an account for UpWork and applied there that I was looking for a writer for a fairy tale.
My boyfriend has his own fairy tale and he also went to register an account on the upwork to hire a writer.
Now he asked me to write a request here, since he screwed something up with registration there and was blocked.
 
Here is my boyfriend's text:
 
Hello I am **Edited for Community Guidelines**, this is my first time at UpWork. I'm from Ukraine.
I create ideas for children's fairy tales for this I need a writer.
I am publishing in the USA on Amazon.
 
I registered like this:
- working mail - **Edited for Community Guidelines**
- name and surname get from email - Valerii **Edited for Community Guidelines**
- status - director (I myself manage the processes of the works, that's why I chose this)
- I chose the number of employees - 500 (since there are many people on Amazon who will print)
- when registering, they said to create a company, I created - profbooks
- created a secret word.
- created a separate password.
- created a vacancy to find an employee. (I'll add an example of a vacancy below)
- and I look forward to finding my writer.
But I receive a letter like this:
 
**Edited for Community Guidelines**
 
I tried somehow to write in support, but I could not no way.
Then I decided to create another account for another mail.
I thought that I entered something incorrectly during registration.
In the new registration I decided not to write about employees and the company does not need to be created.
I registered with another mail, and after a while I was blocked again.
I looked on the community for an answer, saw that they can help here.
I asked the girl to create a request.
I understand that UpWork has its own rules, protects its system, fights against money laundering and there is much more good for the system to work.
I just create fairy tale ideas for children 2-6 years old.
I have no idea of some kind of scam.
I am not interested in deceiving anyone.
Maybe I'm a incompetent at registration.
But I'm ready to do everything as needed for the UpWork.
I just need to look for my author and work with him.
I do not want to act somehow not environmentally friendly in relation to the UpWork.
""I am not against war, I am for peace.""
I have already had three days of depression through this problem, I do not know how to solve the situation.
I want to do everything right.
I want to give work to others and work calmly with the UpWork.
I read in the community that here you need to send passport data or video calls.
I'm ready to do this. I do not want to invent anything and look for workarounds.
Help me work within the rules, I want to understand the error and fix it, I want to do everything honestly.
 
Thank you for your understanding, I hope you can understand me.
Sorry for the clumsy English. I hope this will not be oppression and refusal to relation me.
Thank you, good mood, good luck and love, health and happiness for you.

	Flagged for no reason
","Oct 17, 2020  07:03:03 AM","
Hi,We are very dissatisfied with the work of the Upwork team.Yesterday, we contacted Upwork because I was unable to receive 2 factor sms anymore and Upwork wasn't offering any other options on the login page.So I was stuck, the company couldn't access parts of the account, like tax info.The person I was chatting with, had no other means but to throw an extensive identity verification at me.I didn't mind but I knew this wouldn't help with the 2 factor authentication.I started answering the questions and then the chat shut down on me. I have already spent a big deal of time chatting so I emailed back saying that I need help with our company's 2 factor, still.Do you know what we received as a reply? Nothing.They just blocked our account 😡 out of thin air. They didn't try to reach back, for example with an email, asking to reconfirm my identity, because the chat shut down. No they just outright locked the company's account.They arbitrarily locked the account.We have projects and freelancers there and they jeopardized everything.There's no justification as to why Upwork didn't reach back out to us first to verify the owner's identify instead of locking the account especially that there wasn't any reason.Our project was paralyzed, we were unable to move on with work. And this arbitrary Upwork's behavior left a very bitter and unpleasant taste.We were angry, and rightfully so, and we sent an email asking why they did this to our account.There was no reply, again.We got even angrier because this behaviour was completely **Edited for Community Guidelines** style, they do whatever they want, they don't ask customers, they don't care how customers feel.Feeling trapped without a reply, and an account locked for no reason, we wrote a few more emails requesting to unlock the account. No reply. We were so angry about this unfair behavior we used a few nasty words in our emails, and rightfully so,because nothing justifies what Upwork did to our account and how they jeopardized our projects.So why would we act in any better way?Later we got an email that our account has been not only locked for no reason, but also flagged for use of inappropriate language.This is beyond belief.**Edited for Community Guidelines**They just do whatever the ... they want, and customers have to shut up and accept this?Upwork has to urgently reconsider their obnoxious policies, protocols, and behaviour. After all, you're not the only freelance platform out there.

	Any Recourse for Massive Upwork Scammer?
","Oct 13, 2020  10:07:48 PM","
Is there any way to:1.) recover any funds that were paid out to a freelancer who only worked a fraction of the hours they billed for?2.) Prevent that same freelancer from scamming anyone else here on Upwork? I'm guessing there's no way to recover the thousand of dollars I paid out. But, I'm hoping there is a way to prevent this freelancer from taking advantage of anyone else. I wrote an honest, factual, detailed review. But, I feel like that will accomplish little. This freelancer needs to be stopped. LONG STORY SHORT: I hired a freelancer who was charging me 20 hours per week to manage my Google AdWords account. He said it can take several months to see results. Months passed, and I started to get suspicious because there was zero improvement in the account. (The account actually got worse and more costly over those initial 6 months.) So, I had a trusted collegue who understands AdWords look into whether or not there was any work being done on my AdWords account. -- It became instantly clear that this freelancer was not only not doing anything with my account, but he had barely logged into the account at all over that 6 month period. I spent a good deal of time on Upwork and Googling, looking for a way to file a complaint via Upwork. The closest thing I found was this: https://support.upwork.com/hc/en-us/articles/211062158-Dispute-a-Freelancer-s-Hours BUT, I tried to follow the steps, but the options that the article stated would be available, were not. I couldn't find anything about ""Request a fefund"" or ""Complete the dispute form"". Also, this freelancer has been stealing from me for at least 6 months - it looks like I can only dispute a single week? Thanks in advance for any help or direction.

It seems like an odd money grab to limit invitations, then not have a way to uninvite, and finally have no way to message the invited freelancer unless they respond to your invitation?

I've spent as much time in here over the last couple of days, as I've spent actually hiring people. The biggest issue, is that most of it is a simple fix and hey, it's a freelance sight so finding someone to do the work should be easy...if you need to profit, find another way, making it difficult to do business on here is just going to push people elsewhere. Off my soapbox.

	Tips for How  to Choose Clients?
","Oct 8, 2020  04:49:58 PM","
Just got burned on a contract where they said the draft I did missed the mark entirely, when it simply did not. Client asked for special kind of legal document that is drafted in a particular way according to court rules, and simply didn't understand what the document was supposed to look like. Did not even offer to work with me to revise or improve it (7 pages). Just said I'm out but thanks for the work.  As per platform rules my options now are to refund and hope for no bad private feedback, or claim the fee ($200) dispute, win, and still have her bad reviews despite winning the adjudication.  So the lesson is - choose clients more carefully so as not to be in this position again.  From this I have become interested in learning strategies to winnow out potential trouble clients like this on the front end.  Is there any good articles or videos around that can help me with this? Anything anyone can post would be terrific. ThanksTA

My grounds for this dispute would be that my freelancer exceeded the work hours of his commitment.2- If I once canceled my dispute about an hourly project before Friday but my freelancer again exceeded his hours then can I again dispute after Friday? If, yes then kindly tell me how many days I have for disputing an hourly contract, if my freelancer has ended the contract before I disputed for the work diary?3- If a freelancer ends an hourly contract on his own before Friday will the payment of the previous week’s work work be released to him or would I still have the option to dispute for the exeeded hours?Please give me an answer to each question individually.

	How do I get the code for the price I paid?
","Sep 19, 2020  03:54:24 PM","
Hello community,  I Hope you can help it...I had agreed a fixed price with my freelancer. The app development including admin panel should cost 9000$ and the project should be finished in 3 weeks. In addition to a part of the design, I communicated a reference app to her. The target date was very tight, but I had made it clear that this was the basic requirement for me. The code should be pushed to GitHub. It was okay for me to have read-only access to it until the end of the project. After two milestones, I realized that she was going to take much longer and had neglected my project. Even though the milestones were not really met, I paid money to support her and to motivate her. Now I have already paid $4280. I had started a dispute. After the mediation I decided to give her a second chance if things got better. The next talks after the mediation have told me that it will never get better. The quality of the work is not good enough. Many basic functionalities were not implemented. I always have to run after her to make things happen. The functions she describes as finished are full of bugs. Since I no longer have any confidence in her, I have asked her kindly to give me the existing code so I can close the project. She claims she almost finished the project and I would have to give her additional money before I got the code. I would estimate the app to be 60% complete.  I still have to invest more money to finish the code. It is never a pleasant thing to finish someone's code. I also don't know how properly it was programmed.   There are so many competitors on the market that my app might not be successful anymore. She made me loose so much time.  I had taken out a loan to finance the project. Since June, I have been paying $60 interest on it every month. But I cannot yet launch my app as plannedThe project should have been finished by the end of June. Now we are in September. I spent 4280$ + interest at the bank, my time, my nerves and I have nothing for it. She does not want to give out the code.What is please the best way to get out of this project? Thank you Best regards

	Hourly vs Fixed Price
","Nov 21, 2016  10:34:29 AM","
Hello, I have couple of questions , I posted a job and hired the freelancer for hourly pay ,Since most of them simply not interested with fixed price - milestone basis My question is if i pay for hourly,  Am i protected by upwork with the quality of work , s?  Since i can only judged it once the project is fully completed .  With fixed price you can reveiw everything before you pay but on hourly its not there . And How do i know if the freelancer purposely adding hours by browsing stackoverflow or reading something programing related .  or purposely turtle on code , like write some and delete just for adding some hours intentionally ? I know there are screenshots but thats every 10 mins ,  Who watches whats happening time inbetween them . Or hourly contract doesnt fit for coding type of work ? Im nervous actually , ThanksArun

","Oct 5, 2020  12:01:58 PM","
I’m new to upwork and would like to raise a concern with my existing project.   Basically, we agreed to fixed term contract of $2300. I was asked by the agency to setup a weekly payment of $600, they mentioned that they will setup a limit of $2300 from there end so I won’t be charged more then that limit of $2300. But, soon after first week I was charged $1032.58. I raised this with agency and they said it was wrongly setup as weekly payment along with salary. So, they asked me - ""to terminate the existing contract and re-hire them again but this time don’t set up weekly payment amount as it will be adjusted for first week"".But to my surprise, I was again charged $391.40. I don’t know if it’s upwork or agency charging the money, but I seriously find this security breach if money is getting deducted from my bank account without my instructions. I don’t see the appropriate option to raise a complain, please help me on this asap.

	#1 Mistake You Keep Making And Why I Don't Hire You
","Oct 18, 2017  09:07:50 AM","
Hi.  Thanks for reading this post.  I am a fairly prolific buyer here on Upwork and of-course I use other sites as well.  Upwork seems to have one of the most experienced set of freelancers so I keep coming back.  Our mutual goal is to work together and in that effort I wish you all the best of luck but I wanted to take one minute out of my day to share with you again, why I don't hire you. I posted a gig two days ago for a custom website requiring user customization features.  I used as an example the common experience of users going to a T-shirt website and having the ability to customize the T-shirt.  The project is a 30 day delivery project at $2,000USD.   Within 48 hours I received about 49 proposals.  Here is what I did. 1.  I immediately look at every summary profile and DELETE any proposal where the freelancer has less than a 90% success rate.  That may not be fair but that is what I do.  My thinking is somewhere along this line you have taken on a project where the communication broke down.  Maybe it was the buyers fault but as a client, I always think there is a reasonable solution to a problem and it is on the freelancer to work to resolve the problem.  Most buyers are not unreasonable and I can only assume the act in a manner similar to me.  If I had a problem on a project (and I have had issues before) I would not provide a negative rating if the misunderstanding resulted in a reasonable compromise.  UPWORK unfortunately does a dis-service to the freelancer community by requiring all clients to provide a rating.  The fact is, sometimes a gig just goes bad and the two parties were not the right pairing.  While I may not want to recommend you to others, I certainly do not want to hurt your prospects for future work.  I believe that one bad experience with me should not forever damage your reputation on this site.  My preference would be to part ways and NOT rate you.  But when forced to rate you- I will be honest.  I will not recommend you nor will I give you 5 star ratings.  However, I will try to provide a summary of what occured but the truth is, your next client might just DELETE your propopsal before ever reading the note about why you received a bad rating.  I don't have time to read all of the reviews you have received, especially when I have 49 proposals.  Unfortunately for you I will DELETE your proposal if you are less than 90%.  My guess is...others do the same.   My suggestion is do whatever you need to do to ensure the client rates you high even if you think he/she is wrong and you are right.  Sometimes we just have to deal with bad situations.  2.  I immediately DELETE any proposal where the freelancer has not generated any earnings.  Some people will take a chance on newbies.  I don't.  Your best bet is to stay focused on proposals that ask for entry-level freelancers.  Your are wasting my time trying to win a project where I clearly asked for EXPERT freelancers.  You are also wasting my time.  Before you all freak out and try to tell me that while you have not earned any money on Upwork you have all kinds of experiences on other sites...please understand-  I don't have time to read your history.  Here is your challenge-  your cover letters all look the same...for the most part.  Everyone says they have 7 years experience with...blah blah blah.  The only benchmark that differentiates you from the initial proposal review process is you earnings and ratings.  High ratings with now earnings (I still can't understand how this happens) means I am going to filter you out.  My suggestion is to build up some earning on entry-level jobs...even though you think they are beneath you, and then submit for the higher skill projects where the earnings might be more in line with our goals.  If you earn as little as $10k I will keep you in my grouping. 3.  I immediately DELETE any proposal that is either 20% higher than my budget.  Why are you wasting your time and mine bidding on projects I can't afford?  Of-course you are an expert.  Of-course you deserve more money.  The market is what the market is.  I received more than 60 proposals and roughly 90% agreed to do the gig at $2,000.  Except you came in at $3,500.  Bye Bye.  Oh- if you think noboday else can do the job at $2,000 you are really hurting your own ability to win projects on this platform.  Excellent designers and developers on this site will deliver sites as good or better than you... the competition is that good. My suggestion is don't submit proposals on projects that your can deliver on budget.  It is a waste of your time and a waste of mine. 4.  I immediately DELETE any proposal that is 20% lower than my budget.  Same as above.  I don't chase lowballers.  Look- I have been lured into awarding projects to the lowest bidder plenty of times.  Sometimes the gigs go great.  Other times...not so good.  I try to stay within a single deviation of the mean. 5.  Once I filtered out the noise I am left with what I call my preferred grouping.  I then start by reading every cover letter.  In the case of this project, I was left with 12.  I am now going through each proposal.  I took a break to write this post because I was frustrated with the amount of wasted time on your part and mine.  Right now, I have read 7 proposals and only 2 specifically referenced my exact project and/or provided examples of work that was similar to what I am looking for.  The rest of the proposals lacked several things: a.  They did not provide a cover letter that let me know they really read my proposal.  I think they saw $2,000 Custom Website in my title and just sumbitted a bid.  Of-course every one writes:  ""I read your proposal thoroughly and feel I am the perfect fit for your ""Custom Website"" project....blah blah blah.  This just stinks of boilerplate lingo that is sure to follow.  Here is my suggestion.  Open with this: GOOD-  So you need users to customize their products-  great.  I can absolutely help..  Here are some examples of relevant work. BETTER-  Okay- lets talk about why I am the right choice for this gig.  You need users to be able to customize their products-  as it turns out, I just completed this similar project.  You also need it done in 30 days-  I did a quick milestone draft and I can deliver in 28 (or 35...whatever).  Finally, your budget is $2,000.  How about $1,900 (or $2,100).  BEST-  Mike- allowing customers to customize products is something we see more and more everyday.  In fact, we have done many sites like this in the past and I have given you a few examples below.  I personally believe provide a custom user experience like this is a powerful way to differentiate sites and products and in the event that you need help with promoting a site like this in the future, we can help with that as well.  But for now, let me share a path for accomplishing your goal.  First, you said you like a clean webiste.  Whitespace is an important, dramatic and powerful design feature so our mutual goal will be to minimize site noise while maximizing your product visability.  Let's use short copy that packs powerful benefits and features.  You emphasisze customization- so there are several easy to use pluggins that will help us achieve the customization features you require and this will help us save some money.  In fact, I will try to use tools like this wherever we can.  It makes development easier, faster and more stable on my end and administratively, the process is much more streamlined on your end.  Your budget is $2,000 and since I noticed in your profile that you have awareded more than 50 jobs over the past 24 months with excellent feedback, you  sound like a client I would like to build a long-term relationship with.  How about $1,900?  Finally, you said you need this in 30 days.  I have 4 people on my team and we believe we can deliver this project exactly the way you would like in 28 days.  I have proposed a milestone schedule below for your consideration.  If you are ready to start-  I am as well.  I look forward to hearing from you soon. Now the BEST actually could be written in a way that in could be re-used for other projects but my point is the more you CONNECT with me the better.  Here is where I think most freelancers fail.  They fail to understand that their experiences are nearly ubiquitous with every other freelancer.  Let's just stipulate that you are all EXCELLENT.  Now, if we have acheived the commoditization of development skills then we need to focus on a different value proposition.  The single most important feature you can offer a client is UNDERSTANDING.  I want you to pressume you are on my team.  You need to talk about US not you.   You need to paint a picture why you are more than just a developer.  You are a stake holder invested in my success.  Use ""we"" often.  Finally, where is the pickle?  When I order a sandwhich, I only go to sandwhich shops that give me a free pickle on the side.  What is your pickle?  A lot of people offer 3 months of support or more.  That isn't really a pickle anymore because everyone offers it.  What is your pickle? I hope this helps save you time and I wish you all continued success. Mike

So first we sent a proposal to 2 freelancers and didn't realise they were with agencies. Both came back with the same (!) rough estimate for hours.But we interviewed one further and we've made an offer. She assured me she receives all the payments. Is that possible?

Hi to fellow community.We have upwork profile as freelancers and client for almost 3 years.This month we decided to bring people that work in our company on upwork, as way of boosting their profile, and making payments for our company easier. Its 4 of them.We invited them on paltofrm on beginning of this month, we paid them on September 4th.They go through notorius verification process, over 50 times we had submited verification and God know what. All that time, money is at the escrow of Upwork, not moving anywhere.Now we get to fun part, even we went through all that nightmare..... We had 3 freelancers verified and confirmed all informations...... We as client.... but wait for it......None of them can get paid, or actually withdraw their money till 4th finnish his procedure.So pretty much what that mean, if 4th get sick or just disapear or what not, we would have 3 people waiting for money till the end of world.This would be last time this happen to us, as we are ashemaed of our contractors. We as company pretty much had to prove that we are not scamers.Its disrespectfull in so many ways, that its not even funny.If global brand, that try to change way of how online work, cant verify profile in 30 seconds.... well then charge me 1% instead 20%-10%... till you figure it out.As soon as this situation resolve, we as agency will close our account and move to places where we would be respected and threated as real business.

	Sharing my fixed-price experience as a client
","Oct 3, 2020  11:50:47 AM","
I'd like to share my second experience in Upwork, hopefully to help other newcomers. My first experience was hourly for a WordPress website. For this project, I chose fixed-price over hourly. That's better for me. It contains costs and puts the burden of pricing on the freelancer, but it can only be done if the parameters are very clear. In this case, they were: conversion of existing software to a new platform. I estimated the hours and set the price at $4000. I submitted the project and got 40 bids (the maximum?)  in two days.  Now to filter. I chose two of the standard questions. ""Do you have suggestions to make this project run successfully?"" This one gave useless answers. ""What past project or job have you had that is most like this one and why?"" This yielded better answers. I decided to filter the candidates by 3 things: - Those who could show me examples of similar projects.- Those who had 2+ good reviews for projects over $1000- Those who were top rated.I responded to 12 candidates and gave them a demo of my project. Slowly I realized that my project would be much more expensive: it would require a total code re-write. When communicating with the candidates, I discovered the usual friction of the platform owner: Upwork has to charge their fees, so their goal is to make sure communications stay on the Upwork platform. Like Airbnb, Upwork has rules about outside communications. As a client, since Upwork can mediate any disagreement, I want what Upwork wants: for all communications to stay on Upwork. Only one of the candidates really proved that they had researched my project: they gave me a spreadsheet calculating the time to complete all tasks. Many tasks were overestimated and many underestimated: overall probably close. Total bid: $16,000. Among the 6 finalists, the other bids were $3000, $4000, $6000, $35,000, and $40,000. The first three freelancers stuck close to my original bid. I think if I'd chosen them, halfway through the project, they would have required more money when they discovered the full scope of the project. One of the high bids was from a Ukrainian I liked a lot, but at $35/hour, it's hard to compete with the Indian rate of $12/hour. Is the Ukrainian code or communications really going to be 3 times better? Final negotiations with the finalist: I offered $13,000. Based on their time estimate, te, they gave me a 10% discount off their $12 hourly rate as a new client: final price $14,000. I asked for a 3-month guarantee of bugfixes after project completion. They gave me two weeks. The sticking point: they wanted an advance payment of 20%. I said that if 60% of their business is through Upwork, they should follow Upwork's fixed-price model. No advance payment is necessary when the money is in escrow. Upwork says start small to build up trust. Why should I trust them with a 20% advance payment? In the end, I gave in. I said let's go hourly for a week, check their deliverables, then I'll pay the 20%.  As I see it, Upwork is a great way to foster entrepreneurship and redistribute money equitably in the world. The project has started. Let's see if I chose right.

	Most *Edited* IT ""Freelancers"" Really Fronts for Agency
","Oct 2, 2020  06:58:32 AM","
Just to share my experience with others in case it's of value.
 
I have used IT freelancers from Upwork for over a year. My experience of many Upwork IT freelancers **Edited for Community Guidelines**  is that they are either:

Someone who works for an agency and is just a pretty face, with little IT competence, or
Someone who works for an agency who has relevant IT skills, but who unbeknown to you will turn over work you have asked them to do, to far less skilled colleagues, who will do most of the work. Your ability to manage these third parties will be extemely limited there is a high risk of inferior quality or unusable work

 
In my experience, probably 95% of IT ""freelancers"" on Upwork are of this type. You will spend plenty of money and waste a lot of your time on them.
 
To address this problem, I have found it helpful to:

Ask for their Skype ID. If it's smooth and descriptive, eg like ""IT Web Developer"" or ""WordPress Expert"", then they are probably part of a company
See how many contracts they are currently working on. If more than 5, that's suspicious
Ditto if they have loads of short jobs of perhaps $5 to $25 that give a 100% score
Enter into a paid contract with everyone you want to evaluate seriously. That scares away people because then if you give a bad review, it will affect them (if they refund you, your review won't be visible but Upwork says it takes such reviews into consideration when look at success rates)
Make it clear you will test them interactively via video and desktop sharing. A large proportion of people will drop out before the first session is arranged, or do a last minute no show
During the first session, watch out for people giving them whispered prompts and instant message prompts. When they provide an answer to a question, press them further to see if they understand what they're talking about, or whether they simply repeat what they've just said
Make it clear, through a series of intial tasks, that the person concerned will be working tightly with you, and it will be dificult for them to bring in less skilled colleagues to do the work
Make it clear that if they later delegate work to others without your permission, you will report them to Upwork and paste a corresponding review. This helps filter out the competent people who want to pass on work to others.

 
Hope this is helpful to someone! There are great values to be found in **Edited for Community Guidelines** IT freelancers, but one has to proceed with great caution, and be thorough in the evaluation process.

Hello I need help from upwork comunity.I had given a work to a freelancer in upwork in end of August and let me tell you what happend next.I hired him and prepared 3 milestone payments in upwork for this project.The freelancer had told me that he had completed the concept art in 15th of September and wanted full money deposit.I had asked him to show me a progress first before i release the first milestone and deposit the next milestone payment but he didn't listened to me and also he did not showed me any progress.He told me that he will show me the progress and full concept once i deposit the full amount in upwork.I took time and deposited the full amount in upwork this Tuesday.I had asked him to show me the progress but he did not replied me back.The next day when i asked him which is Wednesday he told me that the concept is not finished yet.He told me that he needs 2 hours time to finish it i had given him 2 hours time but he did not replied me back after then i gave hi m1 hour more time but still he did not replied me back.After then i gave him time till the end of the day but he still did not showed me the progress.Today when i asked him he said he needs more time.SO i gave him 1 hour time but still he didn't replied me back.After then i waited for 3 hours but still he did not replied me back.If the concept was not finished then why had he told me in september 15 that it;s done and he need full payment to be deposited at once so that he can give me the final concept.Due to this i cancelled the contract with him and i requested a refund from him.I am very very sad right now and i need my money back from him.Please help me.Please

	FreeLancer Misconduct.
","Oct 1, 2020  01:49:54 AM","
Hello,
I am trying to understand something, for me it seems that we as clients have little protection using this UpWork Platform. We are asked to pay freelancers and fulfill our commitments to and within the contract whereas freelancers get most out of it. In my last job I hired a freelancer, he claimed that he is an expert in a certain field but later turned out to be less than average programmer, many mistakes I found reviewing his work. Eventually I had to end his contract and pay him his hourly premium wage. I filed a claim and was compensated for 2 hours which he had manually added. So the claim did not trigger an evaluation process from UpWork Support Team over the freelancer’s performance nor the deliverable. Till here I was OK because I should have been more careful with the reviews other clients posted on the freelancer, other reviews reported that this freelancer over logs his hours and some had to terminate him as well. However because he claimed that he was expert in a certain field and there were not much other talent similar to this field I had to go with him as my first choice.
 
Moving forward I forgot about it and continued developing the application, recently I discovered that the freelancer added a DLL package and moved some of the original code to it, he added an expiry date so that the code will not work after a certain date (plus one Month). So away from the technical terms, this means that users will not be able to login into the website after that date.  This is intentional act of sabotage, and misconduct on all levels. Luckily I have the technical knowledge and I figured what the freelancer did within few hours and fixed that. I don’t know for sure but I have a good feeling telling me that he did it to other clients. This personality is sick and he should be banned from doing any work. I have a proof from the UpWork work Diary screen shots that clearly show what he did, and anyone with little technical knowledge can understand this.
I don’t want any refund or anything like that, my aim now is really to try and prevent this freelancer from taking advantage of other people.  However with the current non-existing protection to clients from UpWork platform I can’t even report this. So I want to through it here maybe someone can advise me on way forward, or I forget all about it.

	TOS Communication
","Oct 1, 2020  07:42:26 AM","
Are clients informed of the new new terms of service regarding communicating outside the Upwork platform before a contract has begun? More than half of the recent responses to my proposals I've received lately have asked me to communicate via email or cell phone. I have always responded by restating the TOS and asked them to use one of the Upwork channels instead. This is not the most customer-friendly approach to take when trying to engage a new client. Since this is Upwork's requirement, could Upwork remind clients as they repond to proposals what the rules of communication are?

						Let's say I have a project that should take 1 month. And it's extremely important to have it done within a month.Let's say, it has already passed 2 weeks, so 2 weeks left till the project should end. And there's no progress from the freelancer side, not even a beginning of the work.What can be done in such situation? Theoretically, the freelancer still has 2 weeks to finish the job. Practically, there's no chance he would be able to finish it within two weeks.Excluding trying to settle up with freelancer. I'm pretty sure if it was just one day until the deadline, he would still say ""no worries mate, no worries it will be done. Trust me""

	Freelancer has asked for more budget after taking on a job
","Sep 28, 2020  03:55:57 AM","
Hi all,  Not sure if this is the correct location, but here goes.  I've just created a small web research job, and added a budget of $25 (which I've increased to $35 now) with a simple, straightforward description. Out of the 3 or 4 applicants I can within 30 minutes, I did a quick interview and hired one.  We've been discussing how to do the job for the past few hours, and now that he realises that there will be 1-200 rows in the spreadsheet he wants more budget because he ""thought it would only be a couple of hours"". While I don't normally have an issue with this, I feel as though it was clearly explained and they could have done some research first before their proposal submission.  Am I being fair here?  Kind regards,   Ben

	Escrow Refund Approved by Freelancer But Still No Money Refunded
","Feb 9, 2018  12:14:57 PM","
Hello, I had a contract expire about two weeks ago, and as I understood it, the money still in Escrow should have been refunded to me if the freelancer approved. On January 30th, I received an email from Upwork that the freenlacer had indeed approved the refund and that the money would be returned to my chosen payment method, in this case PayPal.  Well, it's now been almost two weeks since that email, the contract has expired, but I have yet to see that refund in my PayPal account. Do refunds generally take this long? If they do, that's fine, it just feels a bit strange that I got confirmations both by email and in my Upwork account, but I have yet to have my money refunded. Anyone go through anything like this before? Thanks!

	Hiring Freelancer PTSD - Advice?
","Sep 27, 2020  02:14:33 PM","
I view myself as an experienced upwork client. However, I'm continually frustrated with over-committing, over-stating their skills, under-delivering, and, now, totally scamming on development work completed.  I hired a developer to meet a very clear specification (a government standard), which they said they had experience with. They <theoretically> completed the work and provided a completion report. So I closed the project.  However, I had another developer review (silly me, after I closed the project), and it is incomplete!   I contacted the developer who says he can get on the phone only. I asked him to respond, in writing, to all of my very specific coding corrections needed, but he is replying he will only do a phone call.   I'm so pssst!  I need to hire another developer to complete the work (or fix whatever he did). Do I have any recourse to get some of my money back? Scammed again! Help! Dana

	Extend Deadline on a Milestone
","Nov 4, 2016  04:41:16 PM","
I am working with a freelance software developer. I am screening him for a larger project by having him do a smaller, related project first. There is really only 1 milestone on this project and it ends today. It's my fault that I didn't extend it out further. The original milestone was too aggressive, and I was under the impression that it could be extended with approval of both parties. That doesn't seem to be the case, though. To be perfectly clear, the work will not be completed by the current deadline. I am perfectly fine with this and don't want it to reflect poorly on the freelancer.Bu, understandably, I don't want to pay until the milestone is completed. So my question is, what are my options? If the deadline passes will this reflect poorly on the freelancer's status, even if I give good reviews? Put another way... does Upwork track the milestones and flag a late milestone separate from what the client (me) puts in the review? Or is a review the only metric by which a freelancer is rated? I am not concerned with the project being completed late, but I want to protect the freelancer from black marks because of this. It's unfortunate that the two parties involved cannot agree to a milestone change. But if those milestones simply exist as means for the two parties to guage progress, and is not part of the final review process, I'm not too concerned about it. Thanks!

Though this wasnt in detail it was sufficent to understand.3.  We agreed on 3 milestone payments and proceeded with the development of the project4. As of date the project is 75% completed with 70% of 2 milestone payments paid. 5. The contracted company now comes back to, and say holdon we have now do a lot of additional work ,     we require an additional payment to proceed to complete your project, as the remaining work      requires more effort from our development team.My problem now is that I am now stuck in the middle of the project, which the development team has stopped work as they want more funds, and I donot see any reason why I will need to pay additionally for underestimation of the project.I would appreciate anyone in the community with some guidance as how I should be approaching  this to remove this deadlock between myself & the contracted company. As end of the day I require the project to complete smoothly.Appreciate your timeSubhani Lafir

Freelancers are often scamming me insisting they can do work that they really can't. I've lost thousands with one and hundreds with another.

One was an editor who managed to make my books WORSE (after editing both 100,000 word books in less than 24 hours which I didn't want him to do but he INSISTED he could so I thought he had people helping him). This person clearly didn't have a full grip on the english language after I read through what they did, but they've already been paid for and refuse to refund.

I recently posted a job for logo design, and I noticed that two of the applicants have the same image in the links to their previous work.  Both have a record or successfully providing services via this platform in past.  Reasonable explainations are possible such as they worked at the same firm and were both involved, but investigating is beyond the investment I am going to make in selecting somebody for my posting.  A little searching suggest the logo was another party entirely.  Is there anything I ought to do in terms of reporting this suspcious content?

Hi all, I have been having an ongoing issue with a developer team i have hired since Feb this year. They are building a mobile app and have reached their total hours estimated for development time per our initial contract. Per mutual agreement, I have paused the contract and they are wrapping up final elements of the app.  Here  is my issue - Communication - it was hard to get hold of them before, now it is near impossible. I just want to get the app finished so i can move on but it has been such a bear getting the smallest tasks done by them.

	Finding shady work in the work diary?
","Sep 18, 2020  05:17:32 PM","
Curious what people's experience here is on how often they find someone they hired is not what they seem to be. Hired a consultant with great reviews and seemed to be a good independent worker. Was very knowledgable at first, but became very unresponsive days later, and only sent meaningless messages for days after getting started. They only billed a day's work, so I checked what was going on in the work diary. I could see a Skype conversation where I could see them sharing credentials we gave them to others. The person's name was also not the name on their profile. The only logged time showed them trying to figure out extremely basic tasks. They obviously have one person who knows a little, and subs the work out to freshers. Fortunately I didn't give them access to anything sensitive (dodged a huge bullet), but curious how often this happens to other people here?

	Freelancer can't meet our requirements as per proposal and will not refund monies
","Sep 20, 2020  01:04:54 PM","
This is the first project we have outsourced via Upwork, after hearing great things about the talent available.Our initial proposal clearly stated our needs.We released funds as the freelancer pushed for it. Silly us released funds.The communication process was okay, although we felt we provided all solutions.Finally, she decided she couldn't meet one of our initial criteria. (To create an option in the checkout process to allow for at least 2 voucher codes to be entered).I said well then job can't be done and we request a refund.She said she'd already spent it and tthere is no way she could afford to refund it and that she feels her hours put into collecting our emails means she earned our money.I responded to say the job is not done, we are not satisfied, 'you couldn't do the job, you stated that there is nothing in the market to meet our need. We know there is. Full refund please'.@DisputeCentre: this is going to get ugly. Job not done. Please provide me instructions to go to arbitration.No one is in business to hand out money for nothing. And no one should take on a job they aren't capable of completing. And no one should deny a refund to a dissatisfied customer (who got nothing in return but 'I can't do it' it's impossible).The freelancer is wrong. I now need my money back. We have recently found an alternative solution. Nothing is impossible.Anyone had a similar situation? Any advice? @Upwork please contact me.

	Freelance requesting payment before pushing code
","Sep 19, 2020  09:29:17 AM","
Hi all. I have been having a difficult experience with a freelancer recently.As work has progressed, he has continually blamed existing code for not being able to implement solutions. After all this, he has finally sent an app build that works as per the job description. However, he is demanding that I release payment before has pushed code and given me the chance to test and build. I released two previous milestones when he sent builds covering those milestones, but he never submitted any code. Am I in the wrong here? What would the dispute center likely say in case he continues to refuse to push code? In essence, builds do represent work, but they are useless to me without the code. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!

Hi Joseph,
Clients are unable to communicate with freelancers unless freelancers apply to a client's job post, or the freelancer was invited to apply to the job, and the freelancer obliged. On this interview stage, you should be able to discuss the project details with the freelancers, and vet which freelancer will be best for your project. Please check this help article for more information about interviewing and negotiating with Freelancers.

Hi All, This issue is happening to us as an agency that is looking to hire software engineers via the Upwork platform . This issues is becoming an epidemic and should be handled in a strategic level by Upwork. Way too often we encounter a scenario in which a profile claims to be a person from Russia/Ukraine/Belarus , uploads an image of a person who has an Eastern European look , has passed many tests on upwork , has an informative profile and overall looks very promising.  With that when asking to conduct a verbal interview over Skype he's reluctant to do so. When we insist , it takes up 10 seconds, just by hearing the accent that this person has nothing to do with Eastern Europe. If it would have been a single case, every now and then , I would have accepted it , but this is becoming a serious issues as we get many such candidates.  Kindly do not ask me to specify names for you to start investigating each individual case. Kindly think of a solution in  a strategic level that will reduce if not terminate this non desired phenomenon.  Thank you,Evi

I questioned her and i got quote a few lies such as ""this company does not have a website"", ""the company is a traditional manufacture of this product from last 20 years"", ""I asked the factory to make me a director so that i can enhance myself as a business woman"". So what she has done is gone out and got 3 quotes from different factories and then used her own comapny as the supplier of this product at the cheapest price - with no history of ever producing or sourcing the product before. I questioned her and called her out on it and made her come clean to which she has with alot of ""im sorry"", ""single mother"" ""just trying to settle myself is not a crime"" and trying to call me 4 times.

	Being blackmailed by a upwork contractor and upwork is not responding.
","Sep 11, 2020  11:16:20 PM","
A bit of context, in 2017 we a company called epicalls, we are a small voip trying to find a niche. I've worked with upwork quite a lot and of course, we decided to do all our dev work and design with them.We had some good and some bad developers, one developer that we hired was really sloppy, earlier this year after much trying we decided to let him go. We paid him in full and we moved on. We understand that you get good and bad devs and we are okay with that.Few weeks ago, out of nowhere he email us and asked us for $5,000 on bitcoin or he would make all our code available to the public. We are not paying him. He made the code public.Now we're in a struggle, the main value of a company is technology, and this developer has expose and killed a big chunk of the future of our company, no investor would help us if he knows our code is public, that plus the added security. A huge investment we would have to do in order to continue being a startup.We tried to get help from upwork, basically they said that because the blackmail didn't happen in their website and we didn't open a dispute after he finished his work (before he blackmailed us), they couldn't do anything.Here is my concern- Anyone can take few jobs with access to private information or technology.- He finishes the jobs and keep key data.- Waits few months, closes his account and then blackmail all the people he worked with.- Upwork won't do anything.Imagine if Uber responded the same way as upwork had. Someone takes an Uber, the ride finishes, the passenger give the driver 5 stars, **Edited for Community Guidelines**, and Uber response is:a) they are just connect people,b) we were satisfied with their work and gave him 5 stars **Edited for Community Guidelines**
c) recommends you to stop taking to the Uber driver.After this experience I would not recommend giving an upwork developer any project more conplex than a wordpress redesign.

Hi! We hired a top rated draftsman through upwork to complete some work on an existing cad prior to build. Intially, we thought he did a great job. He even made a free 3D rendering of the house. I paid him. I saw later that none of the door schedule or window schedule matched. I told him. He fixed some of the window schedule and said doors were fine. My builder asked for a few more tchnical changes prior to build. I hired another archetect off upwork to compplete. She opened the cad prieviously worked on my prior freelancer though upwork and said it was the biggest mess shes seen in 30 yrs as an archetect. I can't open CAD on my computer so of course I didnt know. He had taken my oprigonal cad files and redrawn from scratch but they were dont incorrectly. The roofline I paid him to draw she compared to a child with crayons as it had no specificity for a builder to actually be able to build the roof. Suffice to say, she spent 30 hrs fixing it and i paid her 3x as much. Worth every penny. I reached out to the previous freelancer to discuss and he will not respond. I would like at least some of my money back. Really crazy I cant alter my review either. Do i have any recourse at all or just got dupped out of $600?

My problem with this is that both times the freelancer clearly did not meet the job requirements that were very clearly laid out, and instead of disciplining them Upwork issues them a credit as if everything is OK - no wonder there are tons of fake profiles and low-quality freelancers these days, not to mention the higher fees. It's a bad practice paying freelancers when they clearly did not do their jobs - this only tells them to continue doing bad jobs - because either way they get paid. And who pays them - we all do. Not to mention the time wasted. I can totally relate to the freelancer if the job requiremnts were not clearly laid out, but when everything is crystal clear with numerous examples and the job doesn't get done there should be no pay. To reiterate my point - Upwork is getting flooded with bad freelancers, which results in serious waste of time to me as a client - and this is the result of pactices such as this one.

There is no way i found it at Upwork and kindly stop this bog chat it's really frustrating

	Reporting Freelancer
","Sep 10, 2020  10:46:26 PM","
A perticular freelancer who responded to the job posting, insisted to discuss details on gtalk. After about two days worth discussion, this freelancer proceeded to create and submit a demo with a video recording that was not asked. The demo clearly demonstrated that the freelancer is an expert at it. The video was of poor resolution and I also happened to be in a different time zone from the freelancer, and requested the freelancer I go back home to review it, before I can make any comments. This whole period I have insisted we transact on Upwork. The freelancer literally ghosts for the rest of the evening and this morning (Friday is a public holiday and family day here in the ME), the freelancer throws a tantrum, insists on immediate feedback and communicates rather poorly. I shut down all connections professionally and the freelancer has archived the conversation on Upwork, but I would like to report this behaviour as it seems to sabotage the reputation of the people I find on here. This is the second poor experience with a freelancer. the first one was in rather similar fashion from another one from the same region. I will still be making the job post and choosing another region, but I thought I should raise a ticket and report this freelancer for his indecent and unprofessional behaviour. Look forward to feedback/suggestions. thanks

	Charged twice for a hourly contract
","Aug 5, 2019  08:51:49 PM","
I started an hourly contract with a freelancer on a trial basis. The contract was capped at 10 hours/week. The first week started on July 29 and ended on August 4. The hourly rate was $18/hour, or $180/week. However, yesterday - August 5 -  I was charged twice, i.e. $360 for the contract. I was given one invoice under the title head 'Hourly' and another under the 'Salary' head.  The freelancer himself has logged 10 hours for the contract. So why is there a second ""Salary"" head? Can someone please tell me what's going on? Why am I being charged twice? I've only used fixed price contracts so far and that usually works out well enough.  P.S.: It's a travesty that UpWork doesn't even offer a support center to resolve client queries. I shouldn't have to turn to the community or the horribly useless support bot to resolve billing issues.

						Last week i paid for 10 hour job and yesterday contract ended all good. Then paid milestone for 2nd contractor and sit 3rd milestone and my card was charged straight away. Now why i get a notification my card declined ? How can we talk to real person ? Some freelancers good people and they just want work and i have worked with few good people but some are not and i dealt with 2 unskilled people too. But what letting upwork down is the communication of customer service! If its not possible to call then instead of robot a person should reply. No disrespect but the community discussion and asking is not solving the problem.

Hello Team,I need someone's assistance about where to address this issue in Upwork.Concern: Translator has finished her task as agreed but it has a lot of corrections in her work. She was corrected some but missed a lot of errors which makes us to use our In-house Team for the final product delivery due to the timeline constraints. I have updated this immediately to the translator that we would deduct 20% from the total for the efforts made by us. However, Milestone has been approved automatically by Upwork due to 14 days' time. Now she received the payment to her account. I have raised a refund request to her twice but she is demanding me to give feedback in Upwork then she will release the fund as agreed. I highly appreciate it if someone responds to this query.

How about a phone number on your site when none of the links provided address a problem that you are having?  Getting too customer support is impossible on UpWork.  I have an issue with a freelancer that billed me over $10,000 for and never provided me with any content or proof of actual work performed.
 
Upwork claims to have a mediation process but you can't find it anywhere on their website.  The free lancer has not responded to my requests for a refund and probably never will.
 
I would never use UpWork again

So, strangely, I had no more news, so I contacted upwork and they helped me to make him understand to do things right. But he did not succeed in my project and told me each time to wait and that he was going to succeed. This is where I am now !!

	Upwork is forcing projects to be finished in 75 days for ""fixed-price contract""
","Aug 25, 2020  06:12:32 AM","
I have been here since Odesk as client. And have spend for multiples of 10.000 USD on Odesk/Upwork. But never have had so much interfering in a contract by Upwork up till now. When a client and a freelancer agree to a fix price contract, the time to finish that project should be solo at the decision between client and freelancer.   Upwork should not interfere with this at all.NOW:after 75 days Upwork sends the client an email:""Your contract, ........ with ........, has been idle on Upwork for more than 75 days after the last milestone deadline.Per the escrow instructions for fixed-price contracts and for your security, this contract will be closed on Upwork in 14 days.When the contract is closed, a refund request for ....... (the funds still in escrow) will be sent to the freelancer. They will have 7 days to dispute this request.If you prefer this contract remain open, take action to keep DATABASE manager active for another 90 days.button to Keep Job OpenI have tried anything. copy the link in the email on the button to ""keep the Job Open"" and pasting in the browser with the last updated Firefox, Chrome and Explorer with Upwork.Nothing worked.I wrote support on February 19, 2020 and they would fix the buy.No support came.No 6 months later, again I have the same problem and again i can not use the button to extend.It looks like Upwork has on purpose deactivated the contract ""extending"" option, and the bug is not a bug because otherwise it would have been fixed after 6 months. Hereby Upwork forces client and freelancer to finish a project in 75 days and that is unacceptable. Many things can happen that an extension needs to be given. Especially now with COVID-19, it can happen that some freelancers can not work all the time. Even family matters etc. This is to much interfering of Upwork forcing client and freelancer in a 75 day period.

So, I am an extremely small crafting blogger. I needed someone to help me to create a more professional looking site for people to enjoy.  I posted a job on here (my very first ever) and chose someone who seemed to know what she was doing.  She told me the exact total cost of $837.50 out of my pocket. (which was HUGE to me because I live on disability. but I agreed) She said this would cover the full site, since it literally is just 6 pages (one of which she never set up)  I didn't have her fill in any information.  I typed in all the site information on all the pages.  She just designed it for me. I told her exactly how I wanted it and even drew out a pictures on paper and emailed them to her so she could see.  She said it was super easy.  I will admit, I love the design, and how it turned out!  BUT, she ended up having me give her a ""bonus"" of $182.00, and then, even though the job description said that my site was on Wordpress, and she was doing all of her work on Wordpress, she later said that I had to upgrade in Wordpress and pay an additional $236.00 for one of her plugins to work?  Now that the site is almost complete, I told her, that when I was ready, I would have her work on my ""store"" section in my site.  Right now, there is nothing there.  She said that would take additional hours.  So I told her to hold off until I could afford it, and had some things to put in there.  Well, out of the blue I just got another bill from her for $49.83.  I suspended the contract.  I have no idea what to do, since I can't seem to contact anyone!

Hi there, I have been cheated by a freelancer who created a website that doesn't function properly. At the time I wasn't aware until it was discovered through end users. When I fired him , I gave him a poor review and he offered a full refund in return to a more favourable review. As a token gesture I said he could keep half and figured he could learn from this. Unfortunately I eventually found that the website did not function properly and that in time it would break down because the coding was a mess. His name is **Edited for Community Guidelines** and he is from **Edited for Community Guidelines**. I regret changing my poor review in giving him 5 stars and have let him know I will have his review changed to zero stars to reflect his work unless he returns the fee. Any advice? Plse STAY AWAY from **Edited for Community Guidelines**. He produces inferior work and is incapable of executing your needs.

	Bad freelancer gives bad review - what can I do?
","Aug 23, 2020  01:02:17 PM","
I have had fairly good results from Upwork in the years I've been using it. Until now. I posted a job for someone to remove backgrounds from images. We've hired freelancers like this in the past who have done 10+ images per hour. This particular freelancer, after over half an hour, was just sitting in Photoshop not really doing anything and hadn't completed a single image. I got upset with him and asked what he was doing, and he gave me some excuse that he was working on it and it was very hard. At this point I just told him I would cancel the contract but give him a 5-star review. I almost always give good reviews because I don't want to ruin someone's reputation on Upwork, especially since we tend to hire workers from poor countries. What happened is that he left me a 1-star review and basically told everyone not to work with me and that I'm a ""bad man."" Out of over 30+ reviews, this is the first review I've had that was not only negative, but a 1-star review ranting about how bad of a client I am. Is there something I can do about this? I realize that I shouldn't have given him a 5-star review and I'm certainly not going to do that anymore, but I would like to deal with this.

	Tracking costs
","Aug 22, 2020  07:07:28 PM","
Hi Everyone,   I'm a longtime user of Upwork but I have ignored proper bookkeeping until now. I decided to track my project costs more closely and I'm finding it difficult. I have hired a number of workers and I do use activity codes. But at the end of the day I see charges from Upwork for a lump sum each period. What I want to get is a breakdown of contractor, activity code, cost per period. What is the easiest way to get this AND have it correlate to the payment I'm charged? I can create a report manually with this information but it seems like there should be an easy and automatic way to download this info in a csv.     BTW, I should note that I have long term contractors that work over many projects. So downloading the weekly summary is no good because it only shows breakdowns by contract. Creating contracts for each changed project isn't a solution either because sometimes we work on different projects in the same week. There's ongoing work. What I really need is a breakdown by Activity Code per person per week.

	Upwork refund to paypal on upwork client account (I didn't get refund to my paypal, no way)
","Aug 22, 2020  10:45:29 AM","
Hello, Everyone. Is there anyone who can explain the Upwork refund and help me carefully? I have posted two tasks about 15 days ago, but the money was refunded by disappearing two freelancers. From upwork community, I knew the refund would come back to paypal within a few days. but I didn't get a refund to my paypal and my upwork balance is displayed $0 in billing method $0 and $100 in transaction history, as you see. Is this system error? How should I get refund to my paypal? If possible, I'd like to get a refund to paypal and when I need to post the job, I'd like to use this money from paypal.If anyone has similar experience and can help me, it'll be thankful.Best regards. (please check the attachments so that to confirm my issues)

	Refund Frustration - dispute #24691636
","Aug 21, 2020  08:31:28 AM","
We currently have a case open with the dispute center we initiated, ID#24583641. I have never had such a frustrating experience trying to get beyond the bot to an actual person.  Our first week on Upwork, we hired 3 different clients. In error, we marked all 3 of them as both salaried and hourly. I called the hotline, who showed me how to fix the error and 2 of the contractors refunded immediately. Unfortunately, the information was not 100% accurate, and it happened again the second week. My peer was able to get assistance through the hotline and fix it as we moved forward. Once again, the 2 contractors were stellar, but the 3rd client ran us around in circles. In frustration, we took it to the dispute center, because after all – isn’t this how they’re supposed to help? The correct answer here is no. It’s a bot, who repeatedly comes back with the scripted answers, regardless of our response. Documentation was provided and clearly shows we are correct yet Upwork is essentially telling me ""Sorry"" with zero further assistance. If you can't refund a salary (which I still don't quite understand) then shouldn't you facilitate the hourly overpayment? It's obvious the client was paid twice. If I am subscribing to the service, isn't this one of the benefits? I'm also quite surprised that this client, after what boils down to stealing, is still allowed access as a contractor. Is there no due diligence on Upwork's side when vetting potential contractors? As of this time, my company over to $10k/month on Upwork. Yet for some reason, I can’t get any assistance. We’ve found some great(!) resources that we truly enjoy working with but I’m genuinely concerned about moving forward.So I’m posting a last-ditch effort on the forum. Any suggestions on my next steps?

Hi. I wanted to test the UpWork for the first time and created a simple formatting job in Excel with a budget of USD 10. The job is now done but the amount requested is USD 20. Is this normal? Does this amount include any UpWork costs I was not aware of? Or is it the freelancer asking for double pay? If it is the latter and he does not agree with decreasing the amount to the one that was agreed, what is the dispute mechanism? The only thing I seem to be able to do is to either pay or request changes to the document. Thanks

	Dispute and feedback process is anti-client
","Aug 17, 2020  08:50:33 PM","
We are new to Upwork and did our first hire for article writing.  We hired a writer who has $80k+ in earnings and 96% positive feedback. Great. 
 
We made him a custom pricing per 100 words offer and he took it. We made some orders until one day I thought a few things looked sketchy. I did a manual scrutiny of the article upto halfway through and found that most of it is directly lifted from other websites. So, plagiarism and paraphrasing. I have all the proof. When I asked him, he plays dumb.  We are new to the platform and I thought it would be best to ask support how to deal with this. They created a dispute and the freelancer refunded for the last 2 articles which I manually reviewed and which we did not use. 
Proof:**Edited for community guidelines**
In the dispute, he picks one of the paras I pointed out and says that he sees no plagiarism in the link while there is a 1:1 lift. That was funny. Claim:**Edited for community guidelines**
Proof:**Edited for community guidelines**
I can expect poor quality articles, even the poorest quality in the world and that would be completely fine and we would just stop working but being dishonest and stealing does seriously put our brand at risk.Anyways, getting to the point, here is the aftermath:- Freelancer gets to continue doing his thing even though he was caught cheating.
- My review is now lost in hundreds of unsuspecting positive reviews by other clients.- Freelancer has left a 1 star review for us which shows up to other freelancers we are trying to employ.- Good thing we can respond to the freelancer's claim and tell our side of the story right? Right? Well, turns out you can respond but it won't be visible on your account and will be visible on theirs. How is that helpful to us? Freelancers will look at our job post and review and will not know our side of story. - Freelancers are now rejecting our job offers based on this one review. Great.

	Terrible First time Upwork experience
","Feb 28, 2019  03:33:02 AM","
Hello everyone,  We are new to Upwork, this is the first project that we are working on here. Now we have this situation, we hired a freelancer to work on an iOS Swift project consisting of 5 milestones. He has completed the first 3 milestones (after the deadlines we agreed about) and was ""working"" until about 1 week ago on the milestones 4 and 5. The problem is, he is not even an iOS Developer and should not be in Upwork. While working on milestone 4 and 5, he created SO many bugs for milestone 1-3, that now we cannot even use the code from them. Plus, he clearly cannot finish milestone 4 and 5, because each time he fixes a bug, he creates at least 2 more. It's a never ending circle and we wasted money and time. He claimed multiple times he completed tasks, completely ignoring specifications and istructions, we wasted time testing and finding the tasks he claimed were done were not, plus additional bugs in parts of the project which should not have been touched even were created. Another thing that he did is that he shared our project with another developer. We noticed another user making commits in Github. He did this without asikng us or even informing us about it. How are our projects safe in the hands of such people? He also had the audacity to tell the Mediation Assistant that he did not share the project with a third party, he: ""used a local laptop and did not notice that it was not my account."", which is nonsense, simply not possible to do by accident.  Now we wait for the Mediation Specialist. We are seeking a full refund because the code is useless, the developer is not capable of completing the project and he has shared the code with third parties. This kind of freelancers just calling themselves developers should not be here at all. Has anyone had a similar situation to this? How did you handle it? What kind of advice can you offer us?

Hey guys, I'm Luciano from Brazil and I have a question about a contract with a client. He proposed to me to do some research about the line production of a certain product in Brazil. For this work, he funded some money on Upwork for me. I did the research but the problem is I am not an Engineer so to describe the entire line production of that industry and I'm counting with a report of an engineer. So there are two payments, my payment (funded on Upwork) and the amount to the engineer here.

","Aug 10, 2020  01:14:08 PM","
I posted a job looking for a Senior Front End Engineer. I only allowed people from the U.S. to apply to my job. I setup an interview with 8 of them, seven of these canidates were completely fake. They were unable to answer very simple questions about engineering, or they had no general knowledge of the city they were living in.  Is this website just a place to hire scammers?

	New fees for Freelancers
","Jul 1, 2019  01:10:06 PM","
			
				
					
					
						I am a Customer who is assessing the impact of the new freelancer fees. I am >$10,000 with same Client but I have some concerns for any new Clients. Here are my points.1. Small fee for applying for a job is great. It weeds out time wasters and makes my life easier.2. 20% for freelancer for under $500 is too steep. It is the end client who will pay via mark up and will discourage new entrants.2. 10% for freelancer for under $10,000 wont work. Client will be charged extra by freelancer, so now we post a $10,000 job for $1,000 and do the $9,000 offline. Multiple milestones paid upfront will mitigate risk.3. I think PayPal Buyer protection fees will mitigate any residual risk.4. Once freelancer and client become confident then both will completely bypass Upwork.5. You Guys really need to think again.

	unable to verify billing method
","Mar 25, 2019  08:33:11 PM","
The directions on billing verification were very unclear, and the automated help almost worthless. I finally figured out what I am supposed to do in order to verify billing, but I can't because I entered the wrong amounts too many times, and now the option no longer populates when I click on the ""verify now"" link. The help information says that the upwork team has to verify billing with me.So for those of you that aren't clear, when you register your credit card, upwork makes two charges (that will be reimbursed after verification). You input those charges in the verification window. If you input the wrong informaiton in there 3 times or more, you'll be locked out until upwork staff can (hopefully) help you out.

	Feature request: Show invoices as paid
","May 22, 2017  03:35:30 PM","
 I hired some freelancers on Upwork on behalf of a client (outside Upwork), and I need to bill my client for the expense. I can download receipts showing my payments to Upwork, but there is no way to connect them to invoices for particular work from the freelancers I hired. Separately, I can download invoices showing what I owe, but there is no way to show that those invoices have been paid. The best I can do, according to Upwork support, is download all my invoices and all my receipts, and then show the whole mess to the client, highlighting individual reference IDs in each one to show that they all match up. It would be really much simpler if there was some way to download an invoice that was marked as ""paid"" so I could just show my clients the invoiced amount, the paid amount, and the remaining balance of $0.00. Hotels do this! When you check out they will give you a bill and show at the bottom that it has been paid. I wish Upwork did too. Could Upwork maybe add that feature?

Hello, I have a suspicion that one of my newly hired developer (paid per hour) is subcontracting out the work I've hired him to do. My suspicions are raised by: The keywoboard activity is consistently high, but the screenshots for the work just showing moving around the one file in the code that's not relevant to the work that's being done. I suspect an automatic keyboard movement tool is being used to show activity, when the hired person is not working.No memos are being attached to any of the hours that are being workedWhen code was submitted, it achieved the task, but there is no evidence in any of the work diaries that this person ever opened the files that were submitted. I've hired other developers and can always see their progressThe latest task is a simple one, but this is not being completed in a reasonable timescale with no explanation.The developer is not responding to messages, or answering direct questions about the work How would I raise a dispute about the work that's being done by this person in these circumstances? How would I show enough evidence that this person is not working on the code as they say they are? Thanks in advance!

Greetings, As a client, I want to use my company US debit card to pay the freelancers, but when adding it to my account, I get an unfriendly ""We're sorry, but Upwork does not accept Prepaid or Gift Cards. Please try to add a different payment method."" message.  Obviously the company card it is not a Gift / Prepaid card, but a regular debit card. I can understand that Upwork wants to have some sort of certainty that they want to be able to charge the client, but requesting a credit card seems distrustful on their part.  And since using the company credit card is a bureaucratic nightmare (not to mention losing money on conversion), this only encourages me to go offline / off-Upwork with the freelancers that I hire, because I have enough complications in my daily business job, I don't need a financial complication as well.  I just want to see other opinions on this subject.

	Copyrighted codes use on the upwork coding project
","Jul 27, 2020  09:29:02 AM","
We have hired a freelancer and they think taking copyrighted work and just removing copyright notice is enough to claim the clodes as their own. Currently I have filed a dispute but it seesm like we are being pushed towards arbitation despite of the facts that copyrighted codes are evident on the several places.
 
I have even included the screenshot comparision of the codes in our initial report. Now the freelancer agrees to settle down for 150 USD payment instead of original 350USD.
But my point is why shoudl I pay someone to copy the codes? Will I be doing justice to the original rights holder?? In some pages they may have done some work or stolen and adapted the codes, Is that really what I am after? No.
This step brings me close to thinking I am on a wrong hands. Shoudl we just ignore the payment overalll or release partial payment??
Hope someone can enlighten us. Thank you.

	Odesk Contractor Scam - Bill for Many Hours and Not Deliver any Work
","Jul 20, 2013  10:34:30 PM","
			
				
					
					
						I hired an hourly rate contractor who simply ran the clock to rack up hours, never delivering any work.

This contractor tricks the screen capture system by opening windows related to my project to make it look like they are working, and then arbitrarily clicking/making keystrokes so that they have some activity showing. They could easily be using a bot/app to do the keystrokes and clicks. The applications and windows in the screenshots appear to be related to my project, but there is no screenshot of any work actually begin performed.

This contractor simply clocked as many  hours as possible until they hit the initial weekly limit I set, in this case 12 hours. The contractor then asks me to enable additional hours, and starts making all manner of excuses when I ask to see the work first.

I tell the contractor I will not enable more hours until I can see some work they have done during this 12 hour period that I am being billed for. The contractor refuses to provide anything where I can see work they have done, so I decide to end the contract.

At this point the contractor knows I am not happy. When I end the contract and give a 1-star rating they also give me a 1-star rating. Apparently asking to see some work done after 12 hours billed makes me a terrible client.

Now I have a bill for 12 hours, but nothing to show for it. I received absolutely nothing for the hours I am being billed. I also got a 1-star review with no comment from the provider on my profile.

The screenshots in the work diary and most of the activity levels make it look like the contractor was working, because they have apps and widows open with my project related stuff, and mouse/keystroke activity. This means I'll likely lose any dispute over the hours ""worked"".

Do I have any recourse? What are my options at this point, do I just lose the money?

	Client insists on video call/phone call is bad?!?
","Nov 24, 2019  04:20:32 AM","
			
				
					
					
						Hi everyone,I'm new to this platform. Actually, my friend who works here told me that this is one of the biggest platforms that enables me to hire freelancers for my work.But there is one thing I don't understand. Is it gonna make me look suspicious if I (the client) insist on using video call to interview my freelancer AGAINST HIS/HER WILL?Since my friend got into that situation, he applied for a job and the client contacted him immediately. After hours (literally) of interviewing via Upwork chat, the client suggested that he wanted to ""connect the freelancer to his colleagues"" via Skype. My friend said that he had a poor internet connection and unable to call, he'd rather using Upwork chat section instead, hence the job description didn't mention anything about video call/phone call (the job itself doesn't have anything to do with calling). But the client insisted on calling him, against his will.I ask this because I want to know, since the works I want to post doesn't related to ""interviewing via phone calls/Skype calls"" but I like to interview my freelancers via these means. Will I get suspended?

	How is it possible Upworks financial reporting tools are so bad?
","Jul 27, 2020  12:21:18 AM","
Am I missing something? Myself and my bookkeeper are having an impossible time with Upworks financial reporting and having to use bank statements to consolidate our expenses. Why can't I simply select a month under financial reporting and have Upwork display a simple monthly expense total? Why is it when I download the CSV file or invoices it does it not show which payment method they have used on file? How can I even find the information in financial reporting on which payment method was used? It's not there in any of the data i can pull. We end up spending hours untangling the overly complicated mess of financial reporting which with every other service provider we have is dead simple. Upwork have managed to create something thats not only overly complicated but also completel opaque. Surely i'm not the only client tearing their hair out having to use their reporting tools every month? How is it possible such a large successful company like this can't get something basic like financial reporting right?

	Freelancer angry, bulying and bombarding with messages because I decided to hire someone else
","Jul 26, 2020  10:07:47 PM","
I want complain about a ""freelancer"" that is actually bullying me for taking the decision to hire someone else, end the initial contract I started, because he did not provide clear solution nor I could work with what he gave me, and my project was very urgent. 24 hours later we were still figuring it out because he wanted to ""do the salespage i asked with a different theme"" that the one on my website and that i requested in the jobpost.
As there was no advance, I ended the contract and hired someone else that knew very well what I asked for in the job post and using the Theme on my website. Well, when he figured that out he wrote me 40 messages because he was angry and is feeling entitled to being paid, while actually he wasted my time and delayed with 24h the work I needed. Although I told him we could work perhaps in the future for another project he was just out of control bombarding me with messages last night. His name is **edited for Community Guidelines** and he acts as he's entitled to my time and money. I understand if there is the option to end a contract and hire someone else and reimburse the initial escrow payment it is because that is acceptable. Please take a note about this, because for me this is pure verbal harassment and bullying. He is from **edited for Community Guidelines** and I honestly suspect he does that because I am a female business owner.
I believe his behaviour is totally unacceptable it makes me feel unsafe here on this website. I do not want to be exposed to bullying or giving explanations of why I hired someone else by an angry man - although it was clear why - plus he did nothing for me but made me waste my time with an alternative solution - he wanted to build the page with a different plugin theme I had asked in the post.
Also,as a consecuence he lost the oportunity to work with me further on a much bigger project because I want to avoid working with angry and entitled bullying people like that. I hope you guys can address this type of issues because honestly, it's really unconfrotable.

	Funding future milestones before the current milestone is complete
","Jan 26, 2016  05:44:43 PM","
It appears to be impossible to fund future milestones while the current milestone is in progress. Another thread suggests this is how the system functions, but is not definitive. The thread says to fund the entire project when launching the project. But what if I prefer not to fund the entire project? https://community.upwork.com/t5/Clients/Fund-Multiple-Milestones/m-p/154518/highlight/true#M7842 It is often the case that one milestone is in a hold situation, and I want the freelancer to proceed with the next milestone. But I need to be able to fund the next milestone. If anyone can clarify, please advise. I was a regular Elance user in 2014 and 2015, and this is my first job with Upwork. My view is that the Upwork web site is a big step backward from Elance. Features are no longer available, and it is not obvious how to perform tasks which were easy to perform on Elance. For example1. Only one attachment is allowed. (Solution: need to use zip file, which is more hassle)2. Cannot have a range on the budget (Solution: enter the minimum value, which means no range specified)3. Difficult to see who has been invited to a job (Found the instructions in the forum)4. Cannot fund future milestones

	Would sending many invitations makes a project less attractive to freelancers?
","Jul 23, 2020  12:39:35 PM","
Hello there,My main question is this: Would sending many invitations to freelancers makes it less attractive for them to bid for the project?Recently, I had a book chapter that required editing. I posted the advert and made it available to Upwork community. I could only send a small number of invites, so I decided to pay Upwork specialist to help finding the right freelancer – and I also contacted several freelancers by myself that have been known to me from previous jobs.I received a proposal from a freelancer. I did not respond immediately as I wanted to wait for others to respond first, so that I could compare their skills, experiences, and rates. A few hours later, this freelancer sent this message to me: “In light of the fact that you issued TWENTY invitations, this no longer feels like a likely prospect -- so, if I have not heard back from you before 6 PM, I will be withdrawing my proposal this evening.”A couple of hours later, she sent me this message: “My schedule is now closed until August.”I responded back by thanking her for the proposal and mentioned that she would need to give me some more time to think about the proposals – not just for a few hours, though I appreciate she might want to close the deal as quickly as she could. Also, it was Upwork who encouraged me to send as many invites as possible, as they anticipated a low response rate. They were right, out of 21 invitations, only 5 responded. Nevertheless, as she had withdrawn her proposal, I just left the conversation there.She then responded by saying: “Unfortunately, the higher-rated members on Upwork rarely take on a project that has gone out with a blanket invitation. Whatever recommendations you received about that are not regarded highly by those of us who actually make a living as professional writers and editors. Just today, I've just received a new ranking on Upwork -- Top Rated Plus. That's a new classification for those of us who do superior work.”And then another message came in from her: “If you would like to send me a direct invitation in about 2 weeks, I'll see if I can work it in.”So my questions are:Is it true that sending many invitations put off freelancers from bidding for the work?Could the freelancers actually see the number of bids, because surely this would provide a better picture of who were interested in the project?I also found the messages from this freelancer to be pushy (wanting a contract as quickly as possible), condescending (talking down to client and belittling other freelancers using her “superior” status of “Top Rated Plus” and contradictory (she said she’s closed until August and then ask me to send a direct invitation in 2 weeks if I am still interested in hiring her). What an odd encounter!Thanks for reading and look forward to hearing your responses.

Hi I'm new to Upwork. I've got a task of design of 1,000 images for £400. £400 is all we have for the designs so that's why I figured I'd pay that on completion of the work.

	Your company is allowing freelancers to steal very easily. I can prove this on skype screen share
","Sep 11, 2015  05:03:00 AM","
I can show you how a freelancer easily, dumb easy! Log in 11 hours of work and only did 1 hour of actual working.
 
I sent a dispute but you are allowing this to happen very easily. 
 
Your company is a platform for fraud and its not a good way to run your comany. I have many softwares to tracj work and i can show you how one new freelance billed me almost $500 dollar for hardly any work done but i was looking at you performnace scores and i was averaging their work score and givng them a 8 put of 10 average but i looked closely and i compared it to me other software i was in shock.
 
I use Basecamp, basecrm, rightsignature, + a lot more and i checked his emails and compared it to your screen shots and scores and its not good at all. You paying them time after time when they have 0 mouse moves and 0 key borad strokes. 
 
You are paying them just to move the mouse around and giving them a 10 out 10
 
You are giving them perfect score for doing 50 keystrokes and 50 moves moves per 10 minutes. If they type 45 words per minute that means they can work 1 minute nd move the move around a few times and they would get a 10 out of 10 when they really only worked 1 minute of the 10.
 
Then there are time you show as high as 27,000 key strokes in 1 - 10 minute report. Are they super man, are the hacking the system to show that or is your software clueless or flawed. 
 
I will take hours and hours to show you this information. You should pay me back for my time and consulting how to make your business better after what i show you which with all the money this is making you should have a team cheking the quality of this software, the freelancers and mostly the centers. 
 
The owners of the centers are driving arounf BMW's living large! I was told this and i can prove it. They are taking $10 out of every work hour and they are teacing the freelancers how to scam hard working companies out of their money while they hardly ever show up to the centers to monitor whats going on. They dont care!
 
They have maangers just pumping high school and early college level kids to come work and then teaching them how to beat the system (which is way too easy) and defraud hard working peoples money. 
 
I saw this kid bill me for 11 hours of work and he did maybe 45 minutes of work. That paying almost $40 dollars an hour. This is a joke. If you do not do anything about this I will be bring this to the highest authorities. Better busines Bureau, state attorneys office, I will even pay my good hard working free lancers to post negative reviews and video proof on all social media channels, including YOUTUBE, Rippoffreport, FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM, GOOGLE+ and much much more. You have good hard working employees here that is not something i can contest. But for every 1 good employee the centers are pumping out 10 fraud ones and the centers are the ones pulling the trigger, your the gun and the freelancer is the bullet.

I don't want to make him any problems with his job score and wouldn't rate him bad. He obviously did not read the job description thouroughly and is a good freelancer for other things. Will there still be a rating if the freelancer hasn't even logged anything yet? so nothing was done.

I've seen an artist whose work I like, I want to ask them to quote me for a specific project. At the bottom of their profile there are a couple of ""pre-packaged projects"" that don't apply. Underneath that it says, ""Interested in a different project? Request pricing"" That seems ideal, so I click on it and it seems to go through setting up a job specifically for that freelancer. Strangly, it asks all the usual questions about what skills I'm looking for and who should be allowed to see it and which countries I want to hire from (which all seem irrelevant if I've already selected a specific person, but whatever) - but then I get stuck on step 7 of 8. It won't let me continue (the next button is greyed out) unless I enter an amount in the ""do you have a specifc budget"" box. No, no I don't have a specific budget. But I can't say no, I can only enter a budget. Firstly that's a stupid name for the box if the only answer allowed is to enter a budget!  No I don't have a budget to why can't I skip it without entering a budget??? Secondly, the whole point of requesting a price is that I'm requesting a price!  I'm not saying ""this is how much I want to pay"", I'm asking ""how much would this cost?"" - so why is it asking me to enter a budget??? Am I doing something wrong, or missing something here?

I cancelled a contract with a freelancer because he was unresponsive and asked for a refund.It was mentioned that Upwork will wait 7 days for the freelancer to respond before approving my refund request.Then on the 15th of July, 2020 I was informed that the refund has been approved by Upwork and the transaction will take place after 5 days.Now it is the 21st of July, 2020 and I still did not receive the refund.I tried to use customer support but it was just a chat bot and it did not understand my query.

	WHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR IN AN UPWORK PROPOSAL?
","Jul 21, 2020  04:27:14 AM","
			
				
					
					
						These days, a single job on Upwork attracts up to 50 proposals. This can be overwhelming to clients who want to hire immediately.However, if you (as the client) really needs to hire immediately, you will have to go through a few proposals before selecting your candidates.My question is: how do you were out proposals and remain with a few you can go through? Also, what are some of the qualities you look for in a proposal?I'm sure giving insight to what you look out for in a proposal can help freelancers better craft winning proposals. Let me hear your thoughts, please.

	Are the Entry-Level/Intermediate/Expert pay band names helpful?
","Apr 2, 2017  10:27:03 AM","
Are the pay bands ""Entry-Level/Intermediate/Expert"" helpful to anyone? The salary bands have little to no correlation to experience level, only to the freelancer's self-perception. Freelancers set their own rates.  Upwork has recently adjusted the bands by job category, but the breakpoints are price percentiles, not experience percentiles.  These pay bands and their names are not consistent in a global market. Salary dot com says a junior programmer living and working in Palo Alto commands 15.7x what the same person commands in Bangalore.  Clients do expect that they will get lower priced talent from certain countries. These one size fits all pay band names are highly inaccurate when taking geography into consideration.  I suggest that Upwork apply a different naming convention to the pay bands, like Low/Medium/High, or Budget/Competitive/Premium. What seasoned clients are really looking for in a freelancer is independence. They most often complain that freelancers are too low on the independent thinker continuum.  ""So and so is fine at following directions literally, but it's garbage in-garbage out. His rate is low, but I have to manage his work under a microscope. I spend a lot of time spelling things out for him.  ""On the other hand, there's a guy I pay 10x as much per hour, but I don't even need to send requirements - just a quick note. He understands exactly what we need and just does it. And he's not afraid to challenge me if I'm on the wrong track - he's definitely not a 'yes man.' He brings so much value to our team, it's worth it for me to pay his rate."" Follower/Implementer/Leader is really how clients perceive freelancers, but self-set hourly rates do not tell that story.

	Do freelancers cheat on work diary?

I don't make it a habit to review the screenshots and work diary, but sometimes I do. I've seen some freelancers, that are clearly working. It shows continuous activity, and obvious work progress. But then sometimes I see what just appears to be idle action. Same screenshots multiple times. Nothing updated. No activity for the 10 minutes, but in 1 30 second segment, there is 100 keyboard or mouse clicks. So I wonder how hard it is to cheat on this. Maybe sometimes they just keep the window active and possibly even working on another computer.... Opinions?

","Jul 18, 2020  03:27:15 PM","
I hired a developer from upwork to build a dating platform like tinder with apps and a website and it was going to integrate my new blockchain technology to lock and unlock the chat functions , he told me it would only take 4 weeks , he tricked me into pay him hourly, 7 months later $3600 usd later , after he told me he was almost finished and to go sign a contract to list my coin on a crypto exchange . So I signed a 3 month contract with a big exchange that cost $3000 usd  , that was 2 months ago and now because he never finished the dating site no one bought any coins on the exchange and im out $3000  and the exchange is going to delist my coin soon!! Now the guy says hes finished the job , when i went to test what he was delivering , there were no apps , even the website didnt work at all , the chat doesnt work , he didnt integrate the blockchain , he was supposed to make all the profiles have a coin wallet he didnt do that, he made it so everybody has to send coins to his wallet!! It doesnt  preform like tinder at all , it doesnt use gps it just puts everyone from around the world on on big list , u cant swipe right threw the profiles like tinder ,he made me comunnicate with him threw telegram so upwork had no record of his incompetance the guy even JUST told me after i gave him all that money that hes never even bin to tinder.com to go look at what i wanted him to build!!!! He promised me dont worry everything is going to be ok just keep paying him , I paid him for 7 months , he said it was only going to take 4 weeks . After 7 months he told me to go hire someone else , that he is not a web developer that he cant do the job, and he is a blockchain developer. But it falsley advertises on his profile that he is a web developer see "" I am a software engineer, Blockchain developer, and web developer,I am a writer also ,I like to write travelogue and stories, I have done Translation job also. ""  This guy ripped me off , wasted 7 months of my time , made me spend $3000 on a big contract that was a complete waste because he cant do the job as he promised he could , Im very upset this man ruined my business , cost me  $6600 usd  and wasted 7 months of my life. Im VERY VERY upset with the service that was provided to my threw the upwork platform from that developer , Hes telling me he cant do the job and I need to hire someone else AFTER he took all the money, and made me get a $3000 exchange contract. I want a full refund from this BOGUS web developer for the $3600 hoerly contract he tricked me into , and he should be held liable for the $3000 3 month exchange listing since he never finshed the job properly and told me to buy that for nothing!!!

	Non Disclosure Agreement - Adobe Sign
","Jul 15, 2020  03:09:27 AM","
Hello, it is a required procedure at our company to send NDA before hiring a freelancer for jobs where company proprietary information is shared. We use Adobe Sign which is great for getting NDA's filled out and signed, however, I am not able to do that as freelancers cannot share their email address due to Upwork policies, which is understandable and fine.Has anyone found a way around it, we rather avoid sending a pdf that the freelancer will need to edit with a PDF editor? Is there not an Upwork email address for each freelancer similar to the Hide My Email feature of Apple? Thanks!Stefania

	Upwork considers weekly limit as fixed salary and bills me even if no hours logged
","Jul 13, 2020  12:16:30 PM","
Being a client I created hourly contract with weekly limit of 15 hours per week on the request of freelancer instead of fixed price as she said i will charge only the payment agreed not a penny more. For the first week she did not log any hours but she was working and providing te update with source code as well. So upwork considered it as fixed salary for those 15 hours and billed me even though she logged no hours (zero). But seeing her progress at work i decided to release her payment for the week and asked her to log hours next week as i only want to pay for the hours logged. She managed to log only 2 hours next week and now i receievd a message from upwork that i need to give (Fixed salary of those 15 hours) + 2 hours logged moreThat exceeds my budget for the contract. For now i've paused the contract But how i am supposed to bill her only for the hours she logged not the fixed salary that upwork is considering. Is there a way out? I was reading somewhere to change the weekly limit of hours to ""No Limit"" that way upwork doesn't consider it a fixed salary. Is it true?Thanks

	Charged unexplained salary amount in excess of the hourly rate (1.5x) and processing fee
","Jul 13, 2020  01:56:32 PM","
I have a running contract with a freelancer @$30 per hour. He worked for 14 hours this week so the amount charged to me should be $420.However, a total of $645 have been charged to me which is incorrect. This includes a $225 payment of ""Salary"" amount which we never agreed to. I don't dispute the 14 hours that were worked for, I only dispute the extra amount that was charged from me. The terms were clear that the amount of pay will be based on an hourly rate of $30 and nothing more.

	Freelancer Failed to Complete Job
","Jul 13, 2020  10:59:39 AM","
Hello, We paid a freelancer for 7 hours at their hourly rate to put a basic html form with 5 fields on our website.  Freelancer told us it would take 2 days. One month later the form still doesn't work and the freelancer has basically stopped responding.  What we got is a basic html form, that would take most coders 10 minutes, and well, it doesn't do anything.  Want to open a dispute to get our money back, but the Upwork help area is not working. When you click on a subject it just flickers and doesn't go anywhere.  So, freelancer took our money and didn't complete the job, Upwork support pages don't work, and we cannot find a customer support rep to even contact.  Any advise? If we can't solve this via Upwork by the end of the week it will be a simple credit card chargeback.  Our experience thus far on this site is totally unnaceptable.  Oh, and your mobile app doesn't work either, seriously..... This is the last time we will be using this site.

	How I lost $17,350 to Upwork and a freelancer - Upwork's dirty trick (unlawful in the UK) exposed.
","Sep 30, 2019  01:53:26 PM","
I have used Upwork for several months and always appointed freelancers on a fixed fee contract. However, in February 2019 and agreed to hire him under an hourly contract subject to the freelancer using time tracking. Eventually I hired him at $50 per hour. Upwork was charing my card $2000 per week and I was of the view that the money was kept in escrow. I had no email notifications what so ever from Upwork about hours and I assumed the $2000 was in escrow. The freelancer is from Belarus and turned up in our office in the UK without our knowledge / invitation and to our surprise and said he had a holiday planned and will work from our office for 3 weeks and we permitted. During his time in office, he demonstrated the work in his macbook and was taking a lot of time to deliver small improvements. As we became concerned, he left the UK. I became a bit concenred and contacted Upwork and requested them to remove my card. I was told the card cannot be removed and  immeidately cancelled my card with the bank. Once the payments were declined, Upwork emailed me stating that they have reversed the hours $2800 worth of hours logged by the freelancer was cancelled as the hours logged were manual. I became concerned and then also learnt from Upwork that they have released $17,350 to the freelancer who has not committed any of the code he has written too. I contacted Upwork who attempted to mediate. However, the freelancer informed Upwork that until and unless I pay the $2800 cancelled by Upwork for manual hours, he will not provide the code and Upwork offered me $480 compensation for my loss of $17,350 - which is somehting I rejected. 
 
I then spoke to my bank and disputed payments with my credit card company. Interestingly, Upwork challenged the dispute stating the Work was in fact delivered by the freelancer and provided screenshots of my login history and then separately stated that the I failed to review the worksheet and disptue the hours within 5 days of the invoice and therefore they released the monies to the freelancer. 
 
I requested Upwork to advise where do I go from here and the response received from Uowork is simply we can't respond until and unless we have a Subpoena and keep repeating the same without any regard for the amount of money I have lost. 
 
From the freelancers account, between February 2019 to June 2019, he has earned 920 hours between two clients (one of them is us) and this is highly suspecious. I understand from the other client that Upwork has suspended the freelancers account. Howveer, Upwork is not taking any responsibility or steps to give me any update / steps I should take to recover the monies. 
 
Update (23 Oct 2019)
Following the incident, I have been working with an advisor to get down to the bottom of this. During the term of the above incident (towards the end), I also hired two other freelancers under a fixed hour agreement for a defined small peace of work (Agreed amounts were $52.50 and $600). I also a had written agreement (in upwork chat) with both the freelancers that if they do not deliver the work within the agreed hours and deliver the working modeuls, no payments would be made. The freelancers logged the hours and Upwork released $52.50 and $600 respectively to both freelancers from my escrow account. Sadly both the freelancers failed to complete the modules and I learnt that Upwork has released the money to them. I spoke to both the freelancers and both agreed that they will return the moneies to Upwork and Upwork did nothing. Subsequently I had to chargeback along with the above payments. 
 
As soon as the chareback was requested, Upwork wrote to both the freelancers stating that their hours do not qualify for payment protection and deducted the amouunts respectively - both the freelancers consented as agreed with me. 
 
Now, Upwork informed my bank that the work was delivered by both the freelancers and disputed the chargeback. Puzzled by this I wrote to Upwork's executive team and a lady called Katt from Executive Esclations exposed what Upwork is really about. 
 
**Edited for Community Guidelines**
 
- Freelancers agreed that the work was not delivered and returned the money to Upwork 
- I request a charge back. Upwork emails the Freelancers confirming that their hours do not qualify for payment protection and keeps the money with them. 
- Upwork informs my bank that the services were delivered and I accetped - a false statement 
- Upwork then advises that chargeback is against their terms of service and therefore they will attempt to recoup funds in order to re-pay freelancers. 
 
Cardholders in the UK do have the rights under section 75 of the consumer credit act 1974. Upwork is ignorant enough to think that their terms (if its true) can supersede the law of a land.

What is the point of inviting someone when you haven't even read their profile? Upwork please, either restrict those people's access to inviting hundreds of freelancers or make them read profile descriptions before inviting freelancers. Or maybe once they click the invite button, give clients a questionnaire of 3-4 questions to answer why they want to hire that particular freelancer. Hope you consider this.

	Freelancer Threatened Me
","Jul 7, 2020  09:17:49 AM","
Hi, so I have had my first just terrible experience on Upwork.  I made a post, to hire a client to draw and color some designs for me. I had several submissions with the price that I was paying, included in the ad. Well, then I had a freelancer submit, so, obviously I spoke with them before hiring them. I was completely new to Upwork, so I was a bit confused on how everything worked, like their contract system and such. In the beginning, I made a'mock' contract, which essentially  just outlined everything that I wanted her to do and how much I would be paying for her to do them. As it is against ToS, I did not ask for her signature, on the contract. I read that the only way to go around paying on Upwork is if you pay them a fee and contact them, and that communicatio only had to be on Upwork before a contract was agreed upon. So, I asked them if paying and communication on Upwork was fine, and they said that it was. So, we created a contract. Please keep in mind that she, wholeheartedly, agreed with all of my prices, and when she did ask for a raise, I aske a few questions before giving her the raise that she  wanted. We were supposed to have an ongoing contract where I increased her price every couple of weeks, as my site grew busier. Her work was good, and we agreed on everything beforehand because I knew I wouldn't be able to change artists, in the middle of the project. She was aware of this, as well, as   often told her.  A little ways through the project, I made more  milestones. Now, I always paid her on time because I wanted her to get her money as quickly as possible. But, she never submitted to me the actual works, just pictures. So, I didn't get the png or translucent files that I needed. Apart from that, i thought, hey, I can get it, myself. So, she stopped working and told me that she would like me to end the contract and give her a 5 star review and she would continue working afterwards, on the origina offer. Of course, I was confused and asked her why it mattered since this was long term, and she told me that she was new and it would mean a lot to her if I could do that for her and then we could continue.  She seemed so lovely, thus far, so I didn't think anything of it. I did what she asked and gave her raving marks since I really did like the art. Then I created anew contract, as I said I would do. She didn't respond to me for two days, and when she did respond she said that would only work if I paid her quadruple what we had agreed upon. Mind you, about 33% of the work had been done and paid for. She only asked me, I think, because I told her that I would increase her pay as we moved along and that I needed her for the project. I guess she wanted the price increase immediately and since she thought I needed her, she thought she could get away with it. Obviously, I told her 'no' and that we had a contract that she had wholeheartedly agreed to. She told me that we ended the contract and I had given her raving marks, so unless I agreed to her new price then I would have to find someone else and that would have been caused by my own decision. I even attempted to increase the price, double what we had previously agreed on, but she wanted more because she thought I needed her.  I told her that she didn't deserve the 5 star review that I had given her because that was not a good way to do business. She knew from the beginning that it was a long term job and the price she'd originally been excited about before learning that I could offer more. She told me that I knew nothing about what she did, and that I had become very cheeky and rude before wishing me luck in finding someone else. Obviously, I was frustrated because I'd lost $100+ in art that I could no longer use because it would be unprofessional to have two different artists. So, I posted an ad, found several people who wanted to work for the price I offered, and began a new contract with someone else. I also changed her review to a 1 star review and explained to her why I had done so. She took advantage of my lack of experience with the site, and made me end the contract (she told me 3 times to do so otherwise she would stop working). She was very sneaky. I don't mind offring more when my freelancers ask because I like to keep them happy, but it's the fact that we didn't have a problem until I brought up that I could pay more as time went on that she did this. She was very rude and kept belittling me. So, I was very truthful in my review because I feel that is what upwork is for. Honesty is what keeps the site going. I said that her artwork was really good, but her work ethic wasn't, she could be rude, and that she could be sneaky.  She quickly grew angry and sent me this message.  **Edited for community guidelines** I will upload the files that I have of the 'mock' contract that I sent her, in the beginning, as well as our messages regarding the contract. I never told her to sign the contract nor to work on any place apart from Upwork. It was exactly what I called it, a 'mock' contract, used so that she would know what I wanted to pay for. Neither parties signed the contract, and we made a contract right on the site. Then she told me that I was angry which was unjustified and unnecessary and that I should return her back to the grade that she had, originally. I, immediately told her 'no' due to the fact that she had just threatened, for something that didn't even break the rules, which I'm sure is against Upwork's TOS, and because her work was now worthless to me. I didn't even ask for a refund and instead just hired someone else. I didn't report her or anything, and when I was speaking with her earlier, she did nothing but belittle me and tell me that I had no idea what I was talking about, regardless of the fact that I got 60+ entries on the job where my price was clearly stated and had been hiring artists for years.  She has tried twice now to threaten me because of the 'mock' contract that I sent in the beginning, but as you can see from the screenshots, I told her to look over it, see if everything was okay, and then made a contract on the site. She was never asked to sign  this contract nor do any work off site. We haven't even had any correspondance off the site. She is trying to use anything to attempt me to change her feedback back even though she knows that she doesn't deserve it.   She was very rude and aggressive towards me, so what should I do now to make her leave me alone? I feel that she will continue to threaten and message me until I change her feedback, but she does not deserve it. Is there a way that I can block her? Reused old Thread, ignore past answers, I'd like new ones.

	How to post a paid test project?
","Jul 8, 2020  09:22:55 AM","
Hi there! I'm new to upwork, and I'm hoping to hire a few freelancers for a data gathering task. I read online that it's possible to do a PAID test project, where I can select a shortlist of freelancers to complete a brief version of the task that I'd like the to eventually complete. Of course, I plan on paying them for completing this test project. The issue I'm running into now is how to do this, logistically. Do I simply post two jobs (one for the paid test project, from which I would then invite the ones I want to ""hire"" to the other real job)? Or, is there a way to administer a paid test project for the freelancers that have submitted proposals to the job WITHIN that job? How would this work? Thanks so much for the help!

I just had my first bad experience at Upwork - You'll see if my history I've used numerous freelancers and been very happy. In this case, I ended up feeling strung along, wasting time and effort with a  gal who's profile demonstrats her talent. However, She was unprofessional, delaying a small project on 3 different occasions; hurt shoulder, thunderstorms, and visitors. She produced work on a mac when I requested word-doc template for making changes, and did not making requested changes. The work she gave was sub-par she didn't make changes requested, and I was unable to , on my end.  I let her know my concerns. Without my consent she ended the contract, and refunded me - and I was unable to provide any feedback to other potential clients. I noticed she has no other negative feedback, which surprised me. Is there another way of letting other clients know if there are clients unhappy with the outcome of a freelancers work, if the freelancer quickly ends the contract and refunds?

	Upwork Should Create a Search Option for Private Messages? Post here if you agree!
","Feb 23, 2016  04:23:11 PM","
Hello,Hopefully there are others in the same boat as myself, and can help bring this suggestion to Upwork Developer's eyes.There is currently no way to search private messages for: specific keywords or files. I use Upwork as my primary method of hiring freelancers, this means lots of Private Messages and files being sent back and forth. I've been on this website for atleast 2 years no, so I do have quite a few Private Messages, and by a few I'm talking well over a hundred.Although Upwork is used to find/hire  Clients/Freelancers, Upwork should also allow past discussions and files to be easily accessable, instead of the current ""click and browse"" methodI mean if I'm looking for a conversation that I had with one of my programmers several months ago... having to manually browse takes incredible amounts of time. The same applies for when I'm looking for an old file. I'm surprised that this issue still exists and hasn't been brought to up yet. So I posted it here in hopes of getting some type of resolution.Please Post/Bump if you agree! Also let me know if I should be posting this in a different section of the Forums. Thanks AllRaj

	Freelancers submitting art from Shutterstock / Adobe Stock as their original work, what can I do?
","Jul 5, 2020  05:42:39 PM","
I posted a project for original artwork for various prompts.  Two of the freelancers I hired had the same ten prompts, and two of the images they submitted were the same as each other, which caught my attention and led me to do reverse image searches, which led to me finding the images on Shutterstock and Adobe Stock, along with some other ones they submitted.  The first freelancer I had already paid 3 weeks ago, the other I haven't yet paid. I called Upwork and got a response that they aren't able to discuss plagiarized artwork with anyone but the rights holder of the art, which, I can understand, but I think misses the point of my concern.  It seems unlikely to me that easily verified plagiarized works would go unpunished, but I also might be naive - are freelancers generally able to submit stolen work as their own? Did I get a poor customer service rep? I know I shouldn't have accepted the work from the first freelancer without doing more verification, but the freelancer had a lot of completed jobs and a high success rate, and I'm fine eating what I paid, but I really hope that there's some way to prevent someone I can prove stole work from being able to con future clients.

I have tried with Debit and Credit and they both have the needed funds. I have gone through the process in which Upwork charges the card to confirm its working. I also tried to enter the customer support but every single time I try to access the help related to billings the whole system quits. I have checked if this is just my browser or computer but everything is working, only Upwork keeps on bugging out. Please help.

HelloUpwork charged me $45 when I actually paid the client the actual amount via bonus payment. I have spoken to the freelancer and has no problem I get refunded. Intially we agreed on $30 but I think mistake from my side I used the $25 / hr of which I was supposed to choose the one time project fee. So I paid the $30 of which he did a good job but upwork deducted extra $45.  How do I request the $45 refund? RegardsSharon

	Double Charged
","Jun 28, 2020  07:49:24 PM","
I joined upwork June 18 and on that 1st day I attempted to create an $18.00 milestone a freelancer had requested from me. In the course of arranging payment, the 1st payment method I provided wasn't accepted so I provided a 2nd payment method. Unfortunately for me, after the upwork site finally approved the charge, it actually charged me TWICE (for two $18.00 milestones).  What's especially frustrating is the fact I never received any usable software code from the freelancer.  Being 'double charged' and getting nothing in return is really annoying.  Do I have any recourse or must I just write this off as an experience in getting cheated by upwork the 1st day I joined?

	Freelancer stops working
","Jun 26, 2020  04:20:40 PM","
Hi!I have a problem with my freelancer.We have a 1.5 year relationship. He completed the first version of our game app in last September.Since that time we are working on the second version. I needed it to be completed for christmas 2019 but he didnt worked on it.He always said some excuses why he didnt worked on the project. He always promised that he will finish.I didnt want to find a new freelancer because it is a very big prolem to find another programmer when the coding is half-finished.So I always gave him another chance.In the meanwhile More times he told me that he would stop working if I dont raise his rate. I raised his rate 2 times. He asked a third raise which I was not able to make. He said he got better offers because he became ""top rated"". Please note that he became top rated only because of the 10000 usd I paid him.I also paid him 3000 dollar bonuses to motivate him to work on the project. It worked only for a very short time, then he stopped working again.Probably I should have realized sooner this was not going to be completed, but I have to mention that he completed the first version one year ago - thats why i trusted him.It is now June 2020, and the project is not completed yet! He makes promises each week, and he breaks all of them (working only 2-3 hours instead of the agreed 40). He is not working on the project and I have no idea why he is not doing it, he always telling me some excuses. I've come to the point it's clear that I have to stop the relationship with him. But I have paid a lot of money to him, and now transfering the project to another freelancer will cost me even more money. It is because I have to throw his last months work into the trash as it is an unusable unfinished code.And now I have to find someone else, and I feel his behaviour was very unfair to me. This game was a big love for me and I was working on it very enthusiastic, but now this relationship changed this to a horror story. I would like to know what are my options now.

	Charge on unverified second payment card
","Jun 26, 2020  07:50:37 AM","
Hello, I have tried to verify my Amex card but the charges have not yet appeared on my card - the only ones that seem the sync with the verification process are listed as 'Google Services'. These are still pending and are only $1.00 each. I cannot see any other charges.  However, I have had a job accepted by a freelancer and the first amount for the job has been charged to my  (unverified, non primary) card but he's still seeing my payment method as 'unverified'. I added another payment card as my primary payment method. This has not needed verfification and seems to have been accepted.  So, my questions are:1. Why has my unverified second payment method been charged?,2.  Why am I still shown as not having a verified payment when I have a primary billing card that doesn't appear to need verified?3. Is there a specific 'feature' of Amex cards that means they take a long time for the verification charge to appear?

	Bait and Switch Freelancers
","Jun 24, 2020  09:11:10 AM","
A quick search of the term, 'Bait and Switch' in this community forum reveals many threads that discuss bad clients who change the terms of a contract after a proposal is accepted... but what about freelancers? What are the rules? When hiring for a project, I review a freelancers portfolio and prior feedback... but also the rate that they've proposed. What I'm finding is that after a short period of work (maybe a couple hours or a single milestone) the freelancer asks for a raise. While I have nothing wrong with freelancers raising their rates over time, this seems suspicious that they seem to get the contract by promising a low rate and then immediately ask for a raise once they've started working. As with many businesses, hiring someone new has a cost associated with it. There is a process of knowledge transfer that must occur as we integrate a new hire into our workflow. I always pay hourly and I never ask for work for free. I recently paid for 10 hours of work for zero deliverable before terminating the contract. Just because I wasn't happy with the freelancer's performance didn't mean that he shouldn't be paid for his time... so I paid him anyways. However, I seem to have a repeated experience in which a freelancer asks for a raise almost immediately after being awarded the job. I find this to be dishonest and unfair. It's a case of 'Bait and Switch' in which the freelancer is effectively changing the terms of the contract and I stand to waste my time and money if I don't comply. I'm open to the thoughts and feedback from others here... clients and freelancers alike. Have you had this happen to you? What can we do about it?

	Credit Card Verification
","Jun 25, 2020  04:02:50 AM","
I need to verify my credit card for my first hiring process. Unfortunately, I tried to put in the EUR amounts in the first place since they were the only amounts shown instantly as there is a lag between the apple notification and the statement for my AMEX, furthermore the information that the account will be blocked after 3 tries is only shown after you put the wrong numbers in three times. Since I already attempted to verify the card thrice the button is now greyed out. It would be urgent to be able to verify the card once more since the current project is heavily time constraint and we are not able to extend our schedule. I am currently very unsatisfied with the UpWork support as the only way to verify the card is the direct contact with a support agent, but there is literally no way to contact anyone, no e-mail, no phone number.

	How do I allow a member of my 'team' pay for a job that I created?
","Jun 22, 2020  05:02:33 PM","
I'm involved in a startup with a business partner.  My responsibilities involve much of the technical, while he is involved in operations.  As this is a startup, and COVID has slowed down government processing of everything, we're still squaring away business related things (like company credit cards).  In the mean time, my partner is handling payment through his personal card. I created a job, and in doing so invited my partner to my 'team' in UpWork, and checked the box to allow him to hire and pay.  We went through an extensive process of interviewing and selecting a freelancer, and then tried to send them an 'offer'.  Since I don't have access to the payment card I asked my partner to login and send the offer, but when he tried to add a payment method he received an error that said ""You need a payment method added to your account in order to hire. Please ask the company owner to add a payment method."" I guess UpWork considers me to be the 'company owner' since I posted the project.  However, I cannot find anywhere to give my partner rights to handle payment.  I did try editing the job posting, and inviting him again using the form at the bottom of the posting page, and again checked to allow him to hire and pay. Could someone please guide us, and provide the steps necessary for my partner to enter his payment information for funding of this job without him having the share that payment information with me? Thanks.

","Jun 22, 2020  07:01:09 PM","
I got charged extra $312 for a ""weekly salary"" which was not in the contract. I setup the contract without clicking on anything extra. I can't find customer support, not even sure why I am using upwork with horrible customer service. I understand I can end the contract and setup a ""new"" contract when I do that it is the SAME as I set up the first time. I have read through several threads and I am not clicking on anything that would enable the salary. How can I fix this issue? Because upwork obviously can't help and I won't be using them ever again.

I have a hourly contract and in work diary freelancer uses some kind of keystroke genearator, not very bright though, he generates about same amount of keystrokes per minute always 1900 which comes down to 30 per seconds. Unless I don't understand something about human motor skills it can't be humanly possible. What is my recourse here?

This is my second post and havent gotten that far as the recommendation you provided did not work as the the Refund Request doesn't exist as you described. Please advise on this: I hired a freelancer on hourly basis. For some reason, your system pickes up weekly salary in addition to the hourly rate because we agreed on Hourly rate with max hours per week. now and this is for the second week in the row, he gets two times 160 USD!! Please advise or just stop this weekly salary; it is frustrating!!!!

Hi guys... I am resorting to this thread as I have had no success of getting in touch with a representative from Upwork (which I find quite strange to say the least) - I recently noticed an amount of AED 617 deducted from my bank account by Upwork. As this was not authorized, and no completions of milestones on my current projects, I would like to know why this took place? I cannot even find proof of this transaction on my account/profile ...

	Closing project didn't give option to pay freelancer

The end job form was unclear - It said ""options for leaving feedback and remaining payments will be visible"", but then when I ended the job as ""Job cancelled for other reason"". The job fell through for reasons outside of our control, and outside the control of our freelancer, so we just want to close the project and pay the freelancer the agreed amount. there was no option to pay, and automatically an escrow refund request was initiated, without any warning that this was about to happen. I'm now unable to release the remaining payment, and the freelancer initiated a dispute. This is so much more complicated than it needs to be - I just want to release the remaining escrow to the freelancer

Hello I am new to upwork, haven't much idea about my Escrow Refund process. My Escrow return request status approved and Escrow return approved date was on 12Jun2020. I have read refund usually take 3-5 business days and will be credited into same account. If I navigate to transaction history, it shows me that amount has been credited to my bank account on 12June2020 (but I know it takes 3-5 business days - obviously not on the same day). Today its 22June2020 and there is no credited amount in my bank account.

	Refund for Excessive Billing from India - Work Not Completed - Holding Project Hostage
","Jun 12, 2020  12:05:18 AM","
I have been trying to get a hold of Upwork. We hired an Indian Agency (well, he says they are) - they took the job, began, the first week was OK and then the 2nd week almost none of the work was completed, but billed $1,000 - I complained and they agreed to come back on the Job Monday and finish. Again nothing and then tonight - they charged another $200 saying that they have been working this week. How do I get my $1,000 back and the $200 from today? I complained to upwork last week and no response. Their instructions for completing a refund request are also outdated and don't match what we are seeing on the screen. We won't use Upwork again especially when they allow the Workers to last minute throw a bunch of hours together when we are sleeping in the US and then Upwork automatically charges our credit card without us being able to approve the time sheet or work!!!

Hi Guys Im a very new and a bit lost at this.I hired a freelancer last night to edit and format my 5500 word ebook.on a fixed contract. I got it back a little over 5 hours later (extreamly quickly) and the editing is terrible.Some of the sentences no longer make any sense.Words that were integeral to the story have been removed and there are massive gaps in the formatting. I messaged the freelancer stating my unhappieness at the work done and that It wasn't the sort of work I expected to be paying for.  The responce I got back was pretty much Ive done the work and I expect payed??.. If the work was even half the standard I expected I woul djust probably have paid and got on with it but my book is ruined and Im going to need to try to find someone else to re-edit the whole thing. I'm at a loss here, he's now saying that he is contacting support and he will happy to wait for them to force payment and that I am a bad client who does not want to pay.This is not the case at all, I just want my book to be publishable. Is this actually what will happen?

	Client account suspended after few days of blocked card

Hi, I am a project manager. My client (profile) has hired a vendor on Upwork. Contract is active for more than month already, work is in progress and everything was going fine until client has lost some money from her credit card and was obliged by her bank to block the card. Until new card arrived (in 7 business days), a blocked card was assigned to her Upwork account. We got notifications from Upwork that charge was declined. We knew that we should have updated the card, we just waited for new card to be arrived. 2 days ago, new card arrived and client signed in the account immediately to update billing method to pay overdue balance. That's when she found that account was suspended (""Account suspended, please contact customer support for more information""). She could not do anything - paying overdue balance, ask a question in community (really odd service here), bot was not very helpful as well. All I could thought is that I am asking this question with my profile - is there some way we can reactivate the account and pay our overdue balance (this should be in everyone's interest I believe)? Regards, Konstantine

	Sense for arbitration for jobs under 300 USD
","Jun 18, 2020  02:44:26 AM","
Hi, I have a dispute with the freelancer who just ignores the task description, all terms, and now requires full payment. We are in the mediation process, but it looks like Mediation Specialist is a robot scrip because it doesn't answer my questions, just posts fixed phrases after a fixed time. That's why I'm asking about the details here. As I said, I have a dispute. I'm a client who ordered some kind of work, fully described in the task, with fixed payment 300 USD and fixed time frame 1 month. From the start freelancer showed strange behavior - he was irresponsible, very passive, I waited for each answer several days, he ignored all accepted task requirements, for the month he did nothing. Just spent 5 minutes on the project - I think just to have a chance to say ""I worked"" at the mediation process. Moreover, in chat, 1.5 weeks before the deadline, when I already saw that he didn't have time to complete project, he again accepted term - project completed before the deadline, or I'll request a refund. After the deadline, I didn't get any results, even didn't get a message about a new term or time frame, he even didn't answer on my last request. So I completed the project and requested a full refund as I needed to move forward with my project asap. From this time the freelancer became very active - he started comment each message in a few hours, he started a dispute and requested FULL payment. He said that he worked with the project a lot, spend all time, and completed all that required. But in facts, even in attached to dispute proofs, work results are empty. So, my question - now everything goes to arbitrage with AAA, and I have to pay an additional 291 USD for the project with locked 300 USD. But, does it make sense - to spend money and time to return 9 USD? I see the freelancer planned all of it - of course, most of the clients with projects under 300 USD will not spend time and money, will not risk an additional 291 USD, and will release funds with thinking ""hell with him"". And who will work with Upwork after this?Do I have any other way to resolve this situation? Even if it is possible - I can't push freelancers to return to the project and complete it, by his history now I see - he holds projects for ages without result, even if it 60 USD project. Now he has at least two projects with 1 star and with the same situation in the feedback like mine. Does anyone control such freelancers?Thanks.

	Hourly Freelancer Scam
","Jun 18, 2020  06:03:10 AM","
Good day, I cant find a conclusive way to go about the partial return of funds for work completed by a freelancer that was not acceptable, complete or fit for purpose. We had a peer review by a local developer of the work completed &  the work tendered ended up being nothing more than adding a plug in to our website without doing any integration or completing the tasks as set out in the original job posting. The peer review finished by saying "" I would of done that for free, becuase it would of taken more time for me to write the invoice "". I asked the Freelancer to supply evidence of what they did, but it went no where. I discussed with the Freelancer who agreed to a refund, of which i requested a percentage only instead of the full amount; he can not pay for 2-4 weeks he says. I didnt want to leave myself open any longer to their delays ( Project has run over for 7 days already ) I  have sent a request for the refund of 300USD but i think this just goes to the Freelancer.Can anyone let me in on how I can approach Upwork in a timely manner to have this resolved so I can get this projected completed. Thanks in advance.

	How to verify the payment method and how to know if the first mileston was correctly paid?
","Mar 15, 2017  02:34:43 AM","
Dear Upwork team and members, I am new on Upwork and I am register as client to hire a freelance. I have the following doubts: 1) The first doubt is related to the payment method verification: I have inserted a ""prepayd credit card"" (I charge it from my online bancking account). The system ask me to verify it but I am finding some difficult to understand what exactly I have to do. If I go into my account, the into the Billing methods section I can read: Requires verification. Verify Now Then clicking on the ""Verify now"" link it ask me 2 amounts but I can't understand where I can find these 2 amounts. I can't understand if they are 2 litle movements on my online banking system (at this time there are not) or somewhere here on Upwork. 2) I created the first milestone and I fixed the relative honorary concordat with the hired freelance. Then when the freelance completed this milestone I have pay this milestone. Now into the Reports --> Transactions section I can read something like this: Date Type Description Freelancer Amount /Balance Ref IDPendingPaymentRefundable Deposit - MasterCard 9881 $10.00Pending121940753Mar 14, 2017Processing FeePayment processing fee for Ref ID 121940901 ($2.75)$0.00121940902Mar 14, 2017PaymentPaid from MasterCard 9881 to escrow for funding request 121940900 $102.75$2.75121940901Mar 14, 2017Fixed PriceFunding request for Need help to develop a WSO2 ESB simple project.: Milestone 1 - Setup WSO2 EI with proper https certificate ($100.00)($100.00)121940900  It means that the first milestone was correctly paid to my freelance? How exactly have I to read it? The last line is the price of my milestone ($100.00) on which are charged $2.75 of fee so I think that I paid a total amount of $102.75. So it means that is correctly paid and that my freelance have received its honorarium? What exactly represent the first line in the table? This one: PendingPaymentRefundable Deposit - MasterCard 9881 $10.00Pending121940753 RegardsAndrea

	Change Account Type and still get Free Trial
","Jun 17, 2020  12:00:52 PM","
Hi there, I didn't know adding a payment method would cause my account to be automatically signed up for a free trial and charged in a month. Would it be possible to switch back to the free plan and then get the free trial when we're ready to use the Upwork for hiring? Also, I was never asked if I wanted to upgrade from the free version to the paid version so it was a bit frustrating to see that my account was going to be charged in a month without me knowing. The only reason I saw my account was going to be charged was because I was exploring the website. I think it would be helpful to make it clear to users that when you add a payment method, your account will be automatically upgraded and charged in a month.  Thank you!

	Freelancer failed to disclose that a project would be $40,000 until she took $1,300
","Jun 16, 2020  12:55:01 PM","
I'm highly concerned and thrown off that there is an opportunity for Freelancers who position themselves as Experts in the industry, to start a process knowing the clients goal without mentioning that a project being discussed is 40k on the low end. I happily discussed my goals for a brand positioning with a Freelancer who made it seem straight forward and simple. I happily agreed to her hourly payment and started preliminary groundwork. After I was charged $700 for a call, I paused the contract and addressed my concerns. I explained that if $700 calls were part of the process, they shouldnt be duplicated conversations nor should they be unexpected. I asked for further detail on how she saw this going, as it no longer seemed simple or straight forward. She then said she would credit some time back as it was an ""accident"" and would provide a proposal. The proposal came back at $40,0000!!! At this point, I had already paid $1,300 to fill out 10 questions on a google doc and have 2 phone converesations that repeated eachother almost identically. I explained that I felt mislead and was unsure of why we began a process of that nature without full disclosure of what a goal like ours takes. As this is not something that we can stop at any point and carry on from where she left off, ensuring we can see the entire process through is an important aspect to address when you are an expert. Now she is only offering to credit some time from the one phone call. If she continues to do this to other people, shes going to continue to wrack in money with no intent to move further knowing that when companies come to find out the price tag, they wont be ABLE to move forward. There needs to be accountability and expecatations to protect small companies from people positioning themselves in a manner allowing them to make $1,300 for zero deliverables. How can this be rectified?

	Need to be contacted by Upwork representative for refund
","Jun 17, 2020  04:48:22 AM","
I am the client and contacted my freelancer on June 11 to inform him we needed to bring contract to a close because of financial concerns due to the pandemic. He responded the next day and everything was understood and mutually satisfied. The contract was not ended early but actually was extended way beyond the original offering. I could not find the protocol on the Upwork site to officially end the contract until yesterday June 16.  It appears Upwork took out another 2 weeks of pay on the 15th that I would like to have refunded since no work regarding this contract will have been performed from June 12 onward. Could I please be contacted by an Upwork representative regarding this matter. I don’t see any other way of getting ahold of a representative (no phone numbers or live chat) other that this community forum.

	UpWork Work Diary can be easily deceived and UpWork will not refund
","Oct 22, 2018  08:32:12 AM","
Hi all,
 
Recently I hired a freelancer to help me setup a Magento2 webshop. I am a layman when it comes to Magento, simply because I am not familiar with this tool. The freelancer was aware of this and misused this knowledge, by opening fake files and spending hours in these files and letting me think that she has been working very hard on my project.
 
I paused her contract as she did not meet several deadlines and hired another developer. This other developer told me about the files the previous freelancer worked in for hours and the new developer als told me that it did not make any sense to open these files and even spend time in them. My new developer was 100% sure that I have been scammed. 
 
**Edited for community guidelines**
 
With all clear evidence I contacted UpWork and told them that I want to file a dispute and want a refund, because of this scam. Although I provided a lot of evidence, Upwork refused to refund my money and they did not even disabled the account of the freelancer, which still suprises me.
 
This freelance lady has billed me for 120 hours, while I think she only spend max 40 hours on this project.
 
So guys please check the work diary thoroughly, because UpWorks system is not reliable and they are not willing to refund even though you can proof that you have been scammed.

	Cancelled a funded job. Now what?
","Jun 15, 2020  11:42:23 AM","
Since there is no Upwork support I can talk to I needed help here. June 9 I hired a webdev to work on some order form stuff that we need. Before hiring, I handed him the requirements, the theme he needed to work with, the plugin he will work with. Since he have a nice Upwork profile with positive feedback and decent portolio, I hired him since he said he'll be able to do this in 7-10 days. Now where the did it go wrong?  1. He did not update us of what has he been working on until 5 days later. It was a Saturday. 2. He did not evaluate thoroughly of what cannot and can be done until Monday (15th June) where he already did the job (he said all tasks done). Some of the most important parts that we want done is not possible. This should have been avoided if he read thoroughly the requirements that I have given him before hiring. 3. Unsatisfactory quality of the job. 4. Someone else is working on this job and we have not been informed.  5. Nearly 80% of the work have issues with it and I have to spend 1.5 hours of what has been wrong an note that to him. We have not received a reply for nearly 12 hours even though I messaged him on a working day during working hours, not until we messaged that his work is less than spectacular. Then he replied instantly and it's already midnight!  I told him that we cannot proceed with this and that we lack confidence on him. He said it's ok no problem. So I cancelled it. Even though it's escrowed I cancelled it and chose pay nothing (but needs approval from the freelancer).  Now, what will happen if he didn't approve the refund? He said he is willing to work with me to meet the requirements but I caught him already lying twice, first one is that he said he doesn't work on a weekend that's why he isn't able to update me sooner yet I received an update about the job on Saturday, 13th June.  Second is that there is someone else doing the job. He said his name was ""this guy"" but his Slackname is different so I confirmed if he is really ""this guy"" and he said yes. Now, today I asked him if someone else is working on this job and he said yes. We have not been informed with this! Now that's disappointing. In case that this has gone into dispute, are we on the right here? Are we entitled for a full refund?

	Can't undo the attempt to create a freelancer account; want to go back to client only

It's been a mess trying to use Upwork. A long while ago, I signed up as a freelancer and put my phone number in. I know longer have access to the associate email (I can't even recall it right now). Fast forward and several failed attempt to get my freelancer account working, I created a client only account so I could post a project. Silly me, though, decide to try again on creating the freelance account, to no avail due the phone number/multiple accounts conflict. I'd like to get back to a state where I can check my account since I'm seeing responses come in for my project already -- and clean up the accounts.

	Dispute with freelance writer
","Jun 15, 2020  04:12:32 AM","
Hi, I advertised for a freelancer to write a 30k novel, and received a number of replies.  I asked for some samples of their work to see their writng style.  After reviewing the samples, I chose one freelancer to write for me.  The first and second milestones were outlines, which I accepted and paid for.  The third milestone was the first 3,000 words of the novel. Here is where the issue arose.  The freelancer copied and pasted the first 6,000 words of one of her samples, changed the characters names and city location and then sent it to me.  I don't believe this is acceptable and am not happy with it.  I can only guess that the freelancer forgot they sent this work as a sample during the interview process.  When queried on this, the freelancer said that this is original work and to check any plagiarism tools to see that it has not been used before.  My issue is that I have no way of knowing and they have no way of proving that I am the only client that this sample has been sent to.  I certainly don't want to use it and I feel like it was very unprofessional of the freelancer.  Now the freelancer wants to get paid for this work that I will never use, and their defence is for me to check a plagiarism tool.  I do not want to work with them after this milestone is solved, but my question is do I have to pay for this milestone?  I have tried to report this issue to upwork but never received a reply.

	I am constantly paying for works that are far from what I describe
","Jun 11, 2020  11:18:35 AM","
I am quite unhappy with Upworks procedures. For my both business lines, I have been using upwork to find some copywriters. However I am experiencing the same problems in 60% of my projects. Freelancer has excellent reviews, is very eager to do job, but the output is far from what I described.I experienced the same in my last project today. I wanted a brand story and gave all inputs. Freelancer whom I accepted submitted a totally unacceptable document, just paraphrasing my sentences and then she fought for the total amount, requested a positive feedback and so on. I accepted the dispute, because I am really tired of dealing with upwork's aggressive freelancers. There should be a better way of communication. I am a small business owner, spending time and money at upwork for some works that I will never use. For me, upwork is a platform where you can see excellent reviews and you think you hire a super talent and receive an awful document in exchange.

I created a fixed price contract and then changed the price to a lower budget. The job is now completed and I paid the budget amount and there are still funds in escrow. When I look to see how I can request an escrow fun, it tells me to click end contract and choose a different amount to pay. Now that I have already paid the budget amount, this option is not coming up. I am scared that if I end contract, the funds in my escrow will be lost and I will not be able to get it back. Essentially, my question is, if I end the contract, will the funds in escrow be refunded back to me?How do I get my escrow funds back?

	Freelancer has not followed through on promise. Contract ended. Am I out of luck?
","Jun 14, 2020  09:15:41 AM","
I hired a freelancer to write a Wikipedia article. He was expensive, but had a very high rating. He did the research and wrote an article. He offered to submit the article to Wikipedia and said he would send me the link. Submitting the article was not set as a milestone. When the writing was done, but before submitting to Wikipedia, the freelancer convinced me to close the contract. The freelancer has never submitted the article to Wikipedia and no longer responds to my numerous messages. I wrote to Upwork customer service but they have never responded either. It was my mistake not setting the submission as a milestone. I was acting (and paying) on good faith that the freelancer would follow through. Do I have any recourse?

	Unable to verify card
","Jun 14, 2020  08:00:08 AM","
I created our first contract and paid using a credit card my boss gave me. Due to circumstances beyond her control, she is unable to log into online banking to get the verification amounts. The statement period for the card usually ends on the 15th (tomorrow), and we were hoping to verify using the paper statement. However, I got an email last night saying our account will be suspended in 24 hours unless we verify the card. In order to avoid this, I entered and verify my personal credit card, but I can't change the funding source for the active milestone and I can't remove the unverified card because it is tied to the active milestone. How can I resolve this issue without getting my account suspended?

	Developer on Upwork is trying to get paid for work he could not evidence
","Jun 9, 2020  02:24:04 PM","
I am a client of Upwork invited by a developer to pay by Escrow.I paid the Escow  and was promised my work in 7 days. On the 6th day I had a feeling that the developer was misbehaving and not being honest. He kept saying he had to go and would be back in 30 mins only to then make other excuses. We were talking on skype during the 6 days with no communication on Upwork as he sent a file to me which contained his skype details. 
I posted the project and he said a fee and would complete in 7 days. After the 6th day and not seeing any work I then felt that something fishy was going on.. I immediately assked through Upwork to see evidence of the work he had dome in the 6 days he had been working locally from his own machine. He asso tried to say he was working from my server but kept asking for FTP details. When I asked for evidence again he said he didnt want to speak on Upwork and tried to communicate on skype.
I then realised this was now right and he came back on Upwork and then said I am tired of working on your site. There you go the proodf was in the Upwork chat, he had done nothing and was trying to get the money out of me within doing the work. I asked him if he wanted to continue on my project and could he show me the work he had done so far. But no luck so I cancelled the contarct and requested my money to be refunded from escrow. 
The thing thing I see is that the developer raised a dispute saying I was deleting all the files from the server and that he couldnt get hold of me. WOW what a joke now I am having to go through a dispute to get my money back. The dispute is listed under the ? at the top of the page but I cannot see anymore info under disputes. Cannot contact anyone about the fraud and cannot see what to do next.
I reposted the job on Upwork but have been speaking to other developers and they have said Upwork has many fraudulant developers trying to earn a quick buck..
I have been unable to contact anyone on Upwork apart from a BOT who is about as useful as bucket with a whole in the bottom.
Please be careful when using Upwork there are some real bad people on here. 
I have not found a good developer on Freelancer to do my work but still waiting on a decision on getting my money back.
If anyone knows how to actually speak to a human please let me know.
Will let you know the outcome but here are the facts.
- Developer found on freelancer but told me he preffered upwork. Strange but I trused him
-Sent me his skype details in a file
-Promised he would deloiver everything in 7 days for £100
- Told me to send him the sql database and files which I stupidly did
- Told me he was working on his AWS site locally and not not worry as he would upload by ftp as he did work
- 6 days passed and he maanged to change a logo that I can change in admin area. 
- Kept telling me he would be back in 20 minutes or 30 minutes
- Day 5 I asked to see his work and he said tomorrow we can go through
- Day 6 asked to see work but he said will be back in 30 minutes and then said why are you being like this
-Day 6 finallyu had enough as I relaised he was trying to get money out of me for reaching a milestone
- Day 6 canclled contract between us as he could not deliver or provide me any work.
-Day 6 He filed a dispute to try and get money out of me.
Still waiting for outcome.
**Edited for Community Guidelines**
 
Be aware please and if I was you I would use another dev site.
Cant wait for the dispute as I have all the evidence to show he was a fraud.If you can help please let me know.

He said, ""That's ok for me"".I sent him a direct contract and then he sent me this screenshot (attached).Now tell me what to do.

	Requesting a refund from a freelancer
","Jun 11, 2020  04:53:29 AM","
Hi there, My buisness partner and I instructed a freelancer (webdeveloper) on an hourly contract via UpWork. After 2 weeks of working with the freelancer, it became transparent that the freelancer did not have the request skills and experience that she claimed as she was unable to act professionally and complete the work required. We invested a huge amount of time in trying to engage with her and recongnised that there was no point continuing due to her behaviour and inadequate skill set. Despite being highly unprofessional and rude, she agreed at the end to refund us. We sent a refund request to her and when we did this, she terminated the contract. We do not know if she has fulfiled any steps on her side in order to give us the refund. We have checked ""reports"" > ""transactions"" and can see no record of being refunded. We note from the information on UpWork's website that if a refund is accepted, the funds should automatically be credited back to our account. However, we cannot see any evidence of this in our bank statement or on the ""transactions"". We would be very grateful for a response from someone in how to proceed/ 1. Would we be notified when a freelancer accepts to refund us? 2. What can we do in this situation? I would be very grateful for some help on this matter. Best wishes,Puja

	Contract Cancelled

I hired a freelancer, who after starting the project said it was too much work and wanted to cancel. I agreed to part ways, with no ill will. That said, when the freelancer cancelled the project he used the reason that I no longer need the work done, which isn't accurate. So when i review the contract cancellation it asks me why i cancelled the project? Is there anyway to modify this, so that it's accurate and doesn't look like i cancelled after entering an agreement?

	Non-responsive Upworker - Make Feedback Optional
","Jan 23, 2017  06:25:52 AM","
I had a job where the Upworker discussed with me for about 20 minutes a month ago, then did nothing.  I just got the 30 day inactivity email. In order to close the job, I am being required to rate him on 5 points about which I have no data. There should be a threshold for cases like this under which no feedback should be required. And feedback should be optional, anyway, at the discretion of the client, at least 5% of the time - The $1 threshold is too low to be meaningful. On the other hand, how can this person review me when he never did any work? I guess I should rate him a 1 for communication, but need to skip the other ratings. Obvious, right?

	Fake Chinese Freelancers
","Jul 4, 2018  06:28:44 AM","
Dearest Upwork -
 
I am a premium employer and between my two accounts, I easily spend 400k a year.   I have found that my support as a premium employer has become non-existent.  I have always had great account managers but now they all seem to have disappeared and I have no direct point of contact at Upwork.  I cannot imagine any other business having a client who spends as much as I do and not providing them direct access to an account manager.  But that's not what I am writing about.  
 
My bigger concern is the rampant and OUT OF CONTROL issue of phony freelancer accounts.  I recently tried to hire for a job and out of 5 interviews, all 5 were not in the country they claimed to be from.  Some claimed to be in East Europe and others claimed to be in Canada or the United States.  I voice verified with them and they were all Chinese.   I have been reporting this issue for years, yet Upwork seems to not want to do anything about it.  It seems like it would be pretty simple to weed out these fakes, given that I found 5 of them on ONE job post.  I think that Upwork is turning a blind eye to this problem because they are still getting paid on work these phony developers do.  This is a total disservice to people like myself who depend on Upwork.  By ignoring the issue you are allowing employers to get scammed, the very people you depend on for your business.  
 
At any rate, here are a few of the fake Chinese Profiles for my most recent job posting.  Notice that ALL these profiles say rising talent or top rated:

Dear Upwork Team,
 
I had hired **Edited for Community Guidelines** to complete a task that had 3 milestones. He completed two of them and the third that was the "" code review and changes "" part was accidentally paid by me and I ended the contract and gave him a good review. Now I see that he had not completed the third milestone and is not making any changes in the code. He is not cooperating at all. I would like to ask for a refund from him since he did not complete the task. 
He is now saying he is busy and will not support us. This is highly disappointing.

	Invited freelancer spamming before I even respond?
","Jun 8, 2020  12:15:38 AM","
			
				
					
					
						I thought that even when we invite freelancers that they dont have access to freely message us until we respond to their proposal? I invited a freelancer, she sent her proposal, and has now been spamming me nonstop with follow up messages even though I have never responded to her.I have never seen this happen nor have any other freelancers done this to me. Is this some sort of glitch that she now has free reign to spam me? I know I can block her. I told her to stop messaging me and I will reach out when I choose which proposals to follow up on, because I do like some of her portfolio samples, which is why I invited her in the first place. But if she persists I will just block her. But I'd still like to know why this is happening in the first place.

How do I raise a dispute? 2) is it possible to amend my previous 5 star rating so at least other clients of his are not mislead?

My initial impression was that it was quite good, so I invited him to join a Zoom meeting with the developers. Before the meeting I asked to speak with him on the phone, but he ignored my request for a phone number. So I went ahead with the Zoom and asked the developer to come in 10 minutes late to give me a chance to speak to the GUI guy. When he eventually connected, his english was so poor that it was difficult to understand him, and I could hear car horns blaring and hubbub in the background, which didn't sound like the sleepy sub-urban street he had given as his address! So I asked if he was really in Paisley and he said yes and I asked him about the car horns, which he agreed were loud. It was plain that he was in fact in a small room or internet cafe somewhere in a developing country. I don't know where the mockup came from, but it could have been Photoshopped from anywhere! So now I have spent $675 on a mockup from a 'GUI developer' who has lied on his profile, where do I go from here? Can I dispute the Job?

	Ended A Contract With Funds Remaining In Escrow, But I Want To Release Them
","Jun 3, 2020  04:22:55 PM","
Basically, I ended the contract thinking it would allow me to release the funds in that process (the text said it would allow me to), but it turns out it doesn't. The issue is that it's requesting a refund, but I don't want a refund, I want to give the freelancer the rest of their payment. As a side note, when I go to view the refund request and press cancel, nothing happens. It doesn't cancel the request, it just brings me back to the previous page.The fear the freelancer and I both have is that, if she disputes the request (which will then allow me to accept and pay her), it will hurt her success rate or reflect negatively upon her, which we don't want.Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

	Account on hold: identity validation
","Jun 3, 2020  02:34:40 AM","
Hi,  I have been using UpWork for a brief period of time as a Client. I have posted a job, talked with freelancers and found one I want to hire. I have tried setting up a a credit card with the name of the CEO but that required identity verification. So I went to setup the company Paypal account as a billing method.  My account is still on hold, asking me to validate the identity of the CEO. This does not make sense if I have Paypal as payment method now. How can I unblock and proceed to hire the freelancer? It's unbelievable what a bad support there is for Clients. Thanks in advance,  Santiago

	As a client, do you agree with Upwork's policy of displaying your ""Full Name"" on your projects?
","Apr 15, 2020  02:35:35 AM","
I was a frequest Upwork user until Upwork started displaying my FULL LEGAL NAME openly on all my projects. While I am not doing anything that would get me in trouble, I do like my privacy.  I have a name which is easy to google, so I don't want my competitors to know who I am outsourcing certain key product development to or who has access to my tax filings and such.  I am surprised Upwork doesn't understand this basic NEED for privacy.  As a result of which, since this policy change we (including my work colleagues) find ourselves using less of upwork and more of **Edited for Community Guidelines**and **Edited for Community Guidelines**, but would prefer to use upwork more. 
As a client, do you agree that Upwork needs to STOP displaying FULL NAME of clients (but maintaing strict verification, KYC)?  
 
PS: I did write to Upwork to display only my first name and first initial of last name.  I got a postive reply (see below), based on which I submitted my name change (first name, last name initial), but was once again rejected. ......

	What has happened to Upwork? It became so bad, bugged and unuseable...
","May 12, 2018  07:25:32 AM","
We already worked with Upwork for many years and spend thousands over thousands of USD here working with different freelancers. We had a break due to the bad quality of Upwork in general and just decided to came back and look if we can go on spending our money here.I cannot believe how bad Upwork has become. We tried to post a job for like 2 days now...we really just wanted to spend some money But its not possible...after many problems and bugs (the support chat had to help us manually due to these bugs) jobs are not visible on the marketplace. We even tried to delete the job and publish again but nothing works.Some years ago i could post a job and had like 20-80 applications in no time. First applications came in after just seconds! Now we wait for hours and days and try different jobs, but 0 apllications and 0 visibility. Instead we receive lots of completely bugged messages from Upwork...for example some ""employee"" will help us to find freelancers...the employee is offline and the message is in archive. We get like 3 mails in a row to activate our mailadress (which has already been done before by the support).Few years ago, in 2 days i could have given like 20 jobs away here on Upwork. Now i cant even find 1 freelancer or post 1 job. Instead i read like thousands of bad reviews outside of Upwork of how bad this platform became. I even tried to contact the support chat again but this is also not possible and after hundreds of clicks i always just end up in this ""community""...i can type a real question or just bs like ""ghjhgjhsd""...both the same for upwork and both will be redirected to Community.Now i sit here and have to decide, if i should spend more days trying to work with Upwork again or just delete the bookmark, laugh a bit and move on...stunned how bad people can present their platform.I guess its really time to move on and leave Upwork alone...few more years and it will probably we gone due to absolute incompetence.

	Reasonable Payment Method for a Pakistani Client to pay freelancers
","Apr 11, 2017  08:29:59 AM","
Hello,I am a freelancer on Upwork. For some work I needed to make a client profile as well. So I made one,  for billing method I have selected my local debit card which is (now) verified by Upwork. The problem is that apart from 2.75 % charges of Upwork my bank stated that they will charge 4% on total amount paid in dollars. I am from Pakistan and my currency is Pakistani Rupees, so when a certain amount deducts from my account in dollars, my bank will apply a charge of 4% on total amount and I am sure there will be other inter-bank service charges too. I need Pakistani clients on Upwork to please guide me of which method/process they use to pay freelancers on Upwork? I know the current options are Credit Card/Debit Card and PayPal on Upwork.  But please let me know how much it would cost to me if I pay let's say $20 to a freelancer from my local account? My account is in Habib Bank Limited (HBL).

But each time I try to do anything on this help site, it tells me to post here. Why???? Why would I post a secure issue on such a public platform? This makes zero sense. Have we lost our minds?

	Assistance With Freelancer Complaint - Providing Non-Functioning Work & Deleting Work after Charged
","May 29, 2020  12:59:17 AM","
HelloI would appreciate some assitance to resolve an ongoing issue I,m facing with my development team. I will do my best to keep it as short  as possible, which will be defficult while explaing my experince and issues.Last year I was seeking a developer after working hard to save up to develope my vission on a online platform that I worked hard to design and create. I hired a development firm that at the time put the effort in to win over the contract. I had provided all the wireframes and scope of the project that needed to be developmed. Prior hiring I wanted to go over everything clearly on all functions, so down the road I wouldnt have to deal with any issues and wanted to be assured ther developer is capable of deveolping all aspects, though as well provide a firm price quote for the project and time frame in a agreement.All criteria was agreed including time frame and price. There was 3 team members assigned to the project and a manager that took lead. They were hired in May/2019 and provided a completion date in August/2019. Which we paid extra to have a faster completion. They proposed all 3 developers would charge 40 hours a week at a rate that was prorated to August completion date, where everything would be fully completed. Im not a developer or really able to check there work and in trust them to perform part of the agreement as I'm sure many people using upwork for these reasons. I would be provided excel sheets with work being done and asked to sign off on it. Some was viewable when the web/Ios/Android versons were avalible to see and some things you were not able to view or test as they were Api or not working as other linking parts were not developed yet. They would continue to ask me to sign off for management to aprove and proceed. I would write my comments or provide screen shoots of things that did not work and needed attention. They would mention they will fix it and work on it. As time went by We reached August were the project was 70 percent complete with many key functions not working as intended, design issues or misalignment issues, losts of things missing and not completed. They have at this point taken all the money as per agreement for them to have completed all the tasks mentioned by due date. We understand there is delays and we remained patient with the developers. They continued to work on the project though over the last 2 months ( aug - oct/2019, you can sense  less priorty to the work and speed in comunication and results in the work. This was even more clear as time went by. As Developers and per the scope it is there job to test and assure the work there doing functions and works, They would not properly test there work, they would provide us the work as it was complete and we would spend many hours constanly checking over and over to only find the same issues constanly presented and very noticible issues not completed. We were very clear on the issues not working that needed to be done.We now arive to October/2019 ( 2 months past the completion date) At this point were 85 percent complete with very little effort or speed and lack of cumunication as in they would take 3-4 days to reply to messges. We would constanly ask and present our issues and frustration was building up as the effort become very obviouse that since they got there money they put a minimal effort into compling the project.We would voice our issues very proffesionally to the  project manager that was barely involved and condination between members was barely non excistant were I had to constanly contact the diffrent members and felt like I was doing his job. The project manager said in October that the work has been completed As far as he knows and that the team needs to be alocated to a new project and if there is anything that needs to be done as they need to delt with let hom know as he needs apply there team members else where. I was surprised by this as It was very clear that there was still alot of issues remaining that were not completed or even functioning. We would provide very visual images and explanations, word documents with images and explanations. Again He just assumes everything was done (even though he knows it not ) Not even testing anything,  They would pick off the easy things and leave alot of it out and again provide work to us that wasnt tested or even functioning. I expressed this to him he suggested how about you hire us for a monthly maintance of 40 hours a month and well be your ongoing support and you can launch and we can assit you along the way. My awnser was clear and it was a No of course not as the work they were paid for was not completed and alot of it not even functioning. They were focusing there attention to get more money or allocate else where. This was really frustrating for us as and was very unproffesional of them as they held our project basicly hostage. He agreed to fix the issues then they would move on. Though months went by and we would constanly send them the reamining same issues still not working and they would take there sweet time and barely comunicate or put time in to resolve this. I should have made a complaint a long time ago. That is my mistake to put up with there unproffesionalism or lack of care for us.Its been a constant strugle with them since october/2019. 2 of the developers part of the firm stoped all together working by directions of the manager and they would reply every 3-4 days doing single taskes every 2-3 weeks. We would constanly send them the issues over and over. The frustration was expressed and they would only reply and put minimal work when we mentioned we would file a complaint. The relationship is beyond repairable when you have someone trying to rip you off and constanly deny and not take fault , though mention each time like hes doing us the favour. though never following threw when he has had nmore then adequite time. I looked to see how long the work he hasnt done would take and its 1 week ! while we been waiting 9 months. I should have cut my losses and its my wrong, though He was paid to do this job and I should be compensated for this and if you ask me for my losses as they took advantage of me, being new to this. They ended up deleting work that was developed and charged to us to cut corners to complete certain things faster and make it easy for them selfs when it totally defeated the purpose and was not mentioned or agreed by us. We had asked for certain pop up Icons to be deleted that were provided in a image circled in red, they went and deleted mutiple interactive charts in the platform as prior were inserted though like most of there work not functioning properly in totally diffrent parts of the platform. They Redirected and deleted payment CSV files from back end Supper admin side to the user front side pop , that is a security breach to make it easier for them selfs and to this date, which is rediculous we provided them this much time to MAY/2020 ONE YEAR NOW! ( ( MONTHS PAST DUE DATE. they still have not resolved the work and held our project hostage. I have put all of my money into this, If I had the money I would take the loss and find someone to complete the remaing 5 percent of the work left, They dont refuse to do the work, they always say there going to get it done. Though the frustration has build in the last 5 months and its very obiouse they had ripped us off, taken our money provided us non functioning work and seek to go were the money is. This has been a horible experince as a first time using upwork to build our dream , as an entipenuer they have taken advantage of us. The development team is very unproffesional and only out to do a quick half functioning job without testing it and constanly deny the fact they deleted work as there scared they will have to refund money, even though the images and screen shots of coments have been presented multiple times. Its clear and they constanlly say there going to fix everything , though they do not. We are tired of waiting and mentioned to them we will seek assitance from upwork. They basiclly said how about you launch and we provide you 2 weeks assitance till we find someone to complete the work. That doesnt work for us, We can not launch when the platform does not function as intended, we paid them, to complete this platform and to fully test and provide us work , that actually works. They bassicly said ""we dont have the bandwith at the moment to complete the work, when we have someone well let you know. we cant provide you a timeline"" That to me after waiting 9 months after delivery date is unacceptable and I have expressed my frustration and comments as I have here to the develoment manager. Which still replies once a week, though is online every day! I Asked and mentioned I will find a developer to complete the remaining work thats not done and you can refund me the money you charged me, though of course we does not give and reply other then when we have somone well get it done. Please assit me to resolve this problem as we have been delayed 9 months and continue to loss money paying all these monthly fees related to the platform. If you can access my messges and read my delima this will be clear to you. All the images and documents are there.We hope this can be resolved and We can move ahead and put this experince behind us as were still hopefull and invission brighter days ahead.Thank youJohn K

	Client gives a bad review
","May 28, 2020  06:32:41 PM","
Greetings everyone, I am new here to UpWork and accepted a contract that has now been ended at $5 an hour, just eager to have a contract. I had passed the interview and even then, the client seemed quite odd with the majority of his freelancers from non-English speaking countries and under $10 an hour. All his USA based workers were paid above this. Long story short, the communication with him was short and brief; and then forwarded to Skype with another person. He then sent me to a final person to work with all through Skype.  Hours were to be tracked on Skype. Communication was only to be on Skype. And at the end of the week, the conversations were to be deleted. I spoke with the client about this and was told that they could not keep communication through UpWork or use that platform for payment. The contract has to be canceled. I reached out to the person on UpWork and was met with some unprofessionalism. After reading on the community forum I was able to get paid for the few hours of work but the review was very poor and stated that I was in the wrong. My review for him was about 4 stars only warning people to make sure they know what's going on in the beginning, and determine what platform is being used. Is it possible for this review to be removed? I still have evidence of the communication between us on Skype and on UpWork.  Thank you for your help in this situation.

When I try to upload a profile picture, I get the message ""Please consider uploading a more appropriate portrait image."" But there's literally nothing wrong with the picture I'm using! It's a picture of me standing in front of a brick wall with my arms crossed. I'm fully clothed in the picture, and there's nothing profane or offensive about my general appearance or the location the picture's been taken. I even use the exact same picture on Facebook and Twitter and have no problems there, so what gives? I've even attached the picture I'm trying to use as proof of what I'm saying. I'd really rather not have to get another picture for something so simple as there is nothing wrong with this picture and in fact I quite like it when typically I don't look the best in pictures.

	Failed to understand billing and payment methods and Overcharged!
","Feb 15, 2020  02:09:34 AM","
Hello,I am new to Upwork and posted a fixed contract job for $300.I hired a freelancer depositing 100$ into escrow. As I had to cancel this  job, I was initially charged $100, however, received $100 credit back and everything was good. I hired a new freelancer for the same fixed contract job depositing $100 into Escrow.The job was completed and i closed the job by paying $200 to the freelancer and expected that Escrow money will be released to the freelancer. However to my surprise,Escrow amount  was showing negative 100$! Subsequently, $100 was  taken from my account and to make matters worse, the freelancer never received the balance $100! The payment summary is as follows:511$ - Debit 511 Credit I fail to understand this nonsense and can somebody explain to me what the hell is going on here. For a 300$ project, i am paying 500$ plus the balance of 100$ to the freelancer, which makes it        600$ all up! Thanks and Regards,Mohan

	How to set up billing payment every 30-days instead of automatic
","May 27, 2020  10:42:15 AM","
Hi, I'm new to upwork and am a client.  I was a bit surprised to see several charges to my credit card without me being notified via email of work and invoices.  I would like to first review the invoice and work done, and be in agreement prior to being automatically charged.  Also, I would like to pay 30-days instead of immediately as in normal businesses.  Is there a way to set this up?

	Dispute only goes back to this week
","May 25, 2020  02:06:04 PM","
I opened a contract of 5/6. The guy billed me on 5/11 and things seemed OK but there were a few errors so he fixed them during the week leading up to the 18th, when I was billed again. When I took a much closer look, the errors remained and things were literally back to where they were when I started. I formally requested a refund on the 21st.  The refund was annoying as I could only claim $100 for the refund instead of the $183.33 which I wanted. He ignored the refund request so I formally opened a dispute on the 25th.  On the dispute, it says I can only dispute the latest charge of the $23.33 which is outrageous. I can even prove that his work wasn’t done as I told him numerous times in the UpWork messages section. My question is: how can I get all of my money back? ***Billing Summary***May 25 - 1:10 hrs @ $20.00/hr - $23.33May 18 - 5:00 hrs @ $20.00/hr - $100.00May 11 - 4:10 hrs @ $20.00/hr - $83.33

	Contractor has completely failed with delivery; any recourse?
","May 27, 2020  08:28:07 AM","
Hello UpWork Community,We kicked off our first UpWork development project to have a contractor write a software driver for a hardware device our company developed.  This project was estimated to take 118 hours, and started in November 2019.  It is now May 2020, the comms with the contractor has been minimal at best, and we haven't seen any deliverables after paying thousands of dollars to the contractor.  I have tried to be patient and understanding, but this is ridiculous.  I have paused the contract for now, frustrated beyond belief, and trying to understand if I have any recourse here against this contractor who has taken advantage of us. I'm really hoping the answer here from UpWork is yes, and that there is some recourse that can be taken...this has been a terrible first experience, and especially in a time when small businesses are struggling, to take advantage of a small business through UpWork is disgusting behavior.  We won't be using UpWork ever again if this is what we should expect. John

	Part Payment to Client
","May 26, 2020  08:37:25 AM","
I have a fixed price project with the freelancer for $800. Twice he has requested $200 payments and I have been happy to give those to him because his work is good. This time he has requested another $200 but it is appearing as a new milestone and suggesting this will add the $200 to the project (i.e. +$200). So, three things: 1. Previously I could fund via my amount in Escrow - I didn't see an option for that this time... 2. How do I pay out of the money assigned to this project? 3. Because the developer has done this before and I have agreed, have I inadvertently agreed to paying more for the project that I originally agreed with the freelancer? Many thanks.

	Freelancer Plagiarism and Cancelling Contract
","May 23, 2020  06:35:25 AM","
Hello
 
I recently hired a ghostwriter to help with an ebook. I have a signed NDA which I know is not the concern of UpWork, but what I do have a problem with is her openly threatening for plagiarised sections I found lifted entirely from other sources. My question is what is the best way to go about this. I understand the NDA is not UpWorks concern, but I don't believe I should have to pay for plagiarized content. Attached are the screenshots of the site she copied and the text she sent me. Will canceling affect my score?
 
Thank you,
Richard

Hello, I have got a message from my credit card organisation that my credit card has been blocked as they have detected suspicious transaction. After additional check I found that indeed unauthorized transaction has taken place exactly the day I placed my credit card as payment method at Upwork. I noticed that I needed to provide my card security code on your site which is unusual and may lead to security breach. Would what be possible? In any case, my current credit card is fully blocked and by the end of next week I will receive a new one. This means however that I do not have a credit card to make the payment coming Monday to the freelancer I work with now. Is it possible to have a payment delay with a few days?If not, could you please help me in what way I make timely payment for the work done this week?Thanks.

Hi, I recently had a translation done on upwork that I wasn't happy about. The original translator (OT) pushed me to pay, and I reluctantly did, but resubmitted his job to another translator, who confirmed that the OT did a google translate cut-and-paste job on the piece. I had to pay again to have it proofread and corrected-- this translator did a wonderful job.  When I asked the OT for a refund, he gave me a lot of abuse, that he later deleted. He has refused to give me the money, even though he was caught in his scam. I asked Upwork for help (this is the first time I have put work on Upwork) but no response. Am I SOL? thanks

","May 15, 2020  07:51:32 AM","
Hello
 
I'm new to upwork and i'm not thrilled with the services provided by upwork support team. My account was flagged by Edward P. stating that I posted a job requesting free work. In my ad I ""NEVER"" requested free work of any sort. I simply stated that the use of SEO & Keywords were essential to any working relationship on upwork. I said that I would test the freelancer knowledge on there expertise in the use of SEO and keywords. 
 
Next thing I know i'm getting flagged saying that i'm asking for free work. I never posted anything asking for free work. How is questioning the freelancer about SEO and keywords considered free work? When we post jobs Upwork give's us the ability to submit questions for freelancers to answer or send in a cover letter. How is me testing there knowledge by asking them questions a request of free work. I wanted to like upwork but this platform seems a bit unproffessional. There are many other platforms out here that offter the same service.

Hi! I have some problems with my websites on AWS and wanted to solve them. Several times I hired freelancer to solve it. They did a small task, I ended a contract, wrote a good feedback. But solved issues didn't solve the problem - accasinally server's loads.I faced with that problen that I spend money, but nobody solve my problem, in a week I face with it again.I decided to move a website to godaddy. Hired a freelancer, not cheapiest. What freelancer succesfully did for told time limit - only moved a database. Time went, money was requested, but I don't really want approve and loose these money and fees. I tried several times to tell a freelancer how to make it faster if some operations take too much time. I moved files by myself because... I just need a moved website and I did it since frelancer cannot and asked to do other things. But instead of it freelancer tried some previous methods again... and again no result. I finished what I started in an hour or 2 and now website almost ready on the new place - SSL, ,htaccess etcSo since it was made only a small part of work and a lot time was wasted - my own too - I want to refund most of money for hours before the payment will be proceeded.I'm really tired of unresposibility in AWS and now websites moving. It seems so like I hire freelancers here in order to increase their rates, write good feedback and after that solve problems by myself. I want to stop doing it and dont want loose money by fees if I pay first and get refund later

Data says the refund is accepted but it doesn't come back to my Paypal account. Then I reviewed the work of the freelancer and it was not done right, we just couldn't accept it. We had to hire another freelancer and pay him to do the work. So we basically paid twice as much for the same project and we lost time. Now, we would like to refund the whole amount of the first freelancer because the job just wasn't done correctly.

	Belated Feedback
","May 13, 2020  01:05:31 AM","
Grrrr... after obediently and tediously hacking my way through the jungle of questions and answers for carving a pathway to customer support, I find there is no actual customer support, but a community board.  Gawd, I hate that.  I've already experienced some glitches on this site, and I'm clumsy with things at best, but at least I thought I could contact someone if there was a real problem I couldn't work around.  So annoyed that I can't.  Well anyway, just quit the ranting and type the question.  My very first Job ever posted was immediately answered by two people, one in Vietnam and one in Ukraine.  Each freelancer replied to my post with an actual product sample, showing me they ""could do it"" and asking me if I wanted to proceed.  I tried to say yes to one and no to the other, but somehow the Upwork system began processing both of them. It's hard for me to remember how that all unfolded, but maybe you'll somewhat understand.  Anyway, I ended up paying the Vietnam freelancer and then apologizing to the Ukraine one, who just said I could have his product for free.  Here's the big point now:  I somehow missed my chance or didn't see the moment for providing Feedback for the Vietnam freelancer.  Now he's writing and asking me if I'd kindly do that, and I would be happy to, but after 30 minutes of clicking all around--going back to My Jobs--viewing the post--etcetera--I cannot find that little cell or window for Feedback.  Can I just forget about that particular pathway and independently submit a review on the Freelancer's profile?  Okay... all those words, but that is the real question here:  How can I write a review on a freelancer's profile?  [and how the heck am I going to see anybody's answer to THIS because it's taken me so long to get HERE and I don't know how to get back.  My email is **Edited for Community Guidelines**.  Someone please please write to me if you know the answer?  Thank you! - Pamela]

	Deferred Billing
","May 10, 2020  09:56:15 PM","
I have often offered deferred billing to clients whose cash flow would be devastated by paying for work as it was done, but who needed the results of my work. Not everyone got the offer, and I didn't offer it if it would put me in a negative cash flow situation. I'm working with small businesses on sorting out two-, three- and four-way barter swaps that need little cash to grease the wheels. Something that cash-strapped buyers need is deferred billing. I'm not aware of whether Upwork facilities or allows that. It's not rocket science, and whenever I use it I keep the client informed of current balance, and commit to billing not more than $XXX per week. For startups in particular, it works well and is sometimes the only way the buyer can afford to work. Freelancers would need to bear the financial risk, and clients the operational risk. If this is the only way a client and freelancer can make a deal work, Upwork's risk is limited to delaying some revenue it otherwise would not receive. Thoughts?

Hey community, how are you doing, hope you're all good. I have a client, who decided that activity less than 50% is not worth paying. I am a programmer myself, following client ideas, I should constantly type code and click mouse buttons without thinking about what I'm doing and how I'm doing this,  beyond that I spend additional time without charging him, on organization stuff of the project, like preparing icons, animating images a.o. Now he is telling me that he won't release payment until I'll not delete those screenshots, I just wanted to hear from your dears, how you would act in a similar situation, because it's seems like my activity with this client is coming to the end from that point, which will probably lead to a bad feedback. Thank's

I didn't blame all on him for that cause My job is creative work and it's hard to find someone who can create what I have in mind. Cause my project is kind of urgent so it will be too late to find another freelancer and I dont' want to cancel the job without paying him anything.

I'm new here and I can't find a direct answer to this question. I need to make a payment to a freelancer in USD. My local currency is not USD.

On a $15 contract, I accidently gave a bonus of $20 when I meant to pay $20 total.

	Freelancer breach of guidelines
","Apr 28, 2020  08:10:06 AM","
I’m relatively new to upwork, in the sense that I repeatedly attempted to hire people that often agreed to start the work, then disappeared when asked further questions about their experience. I was so happy to find a freelancer who clearly understood my request and had a professional website with recommendations, etc. I was anxious to get started and after seeing such an extremely low priced hourly rate I signed a “standard” confidentiality and long term contract agreement. This is where the problems began as the freelancer disappeared for weeks, after a few requests for response I was assured that a team of people were working very hard on my account and that they are busy with many accounts.  Fast forward, months have passed. I wrote the freelancer this is not the kind of working relationship I want and want to end the contract and I’m told that the contract I signed is unbreakable and I must pay the full amount without receiving any of the work. And now I am constantly being harassed for payment. When I looked for ways to report this scam, I see now that this relationship was in breach of your standards, but I am willing to pay the penalty to stop others from being fooled! see contract attached  ( P.s. Where is support desk contact info? )

Hi, I hope all is good with you!I am a new customer. Posted a job on Monday and found a freelancer that gave an offer, we agreed on the terms and started working the day after. He spent 7 hours trying to configure the Router but hi lacked knowledge and just created a mess. I expected him to sort it out the next day but, he just resigned. Didn't charge for the job but disappeared. No reply on the phone, no way to contact him. We were afraid his purpose was something else so we had to spent a lot of time and money to secure our network. A unfortunate first experience.I would like to warn other users of this but since the freelancer didn't charge me I am not able to give any feedback ant it is likely that a new customer of Upwork will have the same experience and I would like to believe that you would like to be able to tell that the freelancers you offer are trustworthy.Please come back to me on this.Best regards/Claes

2 weeks ago I got me a new hourly contract, I was expecting a load of work from the job description. The client gave me a really simple task, it took me less than 10 minutes (which is less than a dollar in my case). On Saturday I asked him if I should expect any tasks in the upcoming week, he said: ""Maybe. Let's me see on Monday"" but he didn't text me again, and I'm a bit confused now,  I don't want to beg clients for work, it doesn't feel right. I want to know how long can I wait without hurting my JSS, and If I ended the contract with earning that are less than a dollar would that still be a contract without earnings and lower my score?I'm not sure what to do!

I am really disappointed about your job system.
Why don't you do a system to agree/disagree job posts? You put a lot of pressure on freelancers and try to make them perfect but shouldn't you focus on clients too?  Look at this post that appeared in my job feed.Also it's annoying to see 10-20 job proposals waiting for a month in ""active list"" even if the clients hired freelancers. Isn't more relevant to delete them or archive after a period of time?

We are both an Agency and a Client on Upwork.

It can be added as a payment method and works just fine for clients in other countries. We would definitely bring more business to Upwork if you'd have these issues addressed. Thanks for taking the time to read this,Daniel

	% of new freelancers attempting scams / fraud
","May 4, 2020  06:36:54 AM","
Most freelancers on this platform that I've worked with are pretty honest, but not all. I'm polling the community for your sense on what percent of *new* freelancers (under 5 previous jobs or under 2 months of history) on this platform are attempting to commit scams or fraud on the platform (loosely-defined). I expect this will vary a lot by region, type of work, and hourly rate. I noticed that Upwork silently banned one of the freelancers I hired after they had sent me a suspicoius email to contact them off the platform. I haven't heard back from Upwork support on why they had banned this freelancer, but I suspect that they were misreprenting themselves, likely with a fake profile.  There also seems to a be a positive correlation b/t fixed-price contracts and bad behavior; anyone else notice this?

","May 1, 2020  02:50:10 AM","
I hired a freelancer for an hourly project. on contract ID: 24149539He added 2 hours manual time after completing project. I did not know how to pay him for it so I sent him bonus of $60 ($30 per hour) as payment. Now, my debit card was currently empty. I realized my charges of $60 are still due. I received an email that failure to pay this amount will result in a suspension. I opened up a ticket for help and customer support asked if they can contact the freelancer on my behalf for refunds or authorization to cancel billing hours. But it has not been updated from 24+ hours.I asked my freelancer to refund the bonus so that I can pay the due amount. He told me to file a dispute then he will be able to refund. I filed a dispute with my freelancer's permission, and he accepted it. Now, my due balance shows $0 which means no pending amount. So I presumed that I got a refund on the billing hours which are now cancelled.Does this mean that my freelancer should still be getting the $60 bonus that I sent him on the contract?But my freelancer says he does not see any such thing in pending or upcoming payments. Now I'm not sure what happened to the bonus that I sent him.

","Feb 18, 2017  05:32:43 AM","
Dear All, I hired a freelancer to work on my project, which has been taking up to 3 months now. They did a terrible job. Whenever they designed something, our team has to spend a lot of time on commenting easy detect mistakes that they made and it should be their responsibility to make sure everything is checked and working properly before sending it to me.  Design perspective, they have no sense of designing, and they claim that they have Graphic Designer. I just had enough of them, 3 months of work, in a good designer hand, can only take 10 days to get the work done, but there're just so many back and forth in commenting their issues and edit. We are thinking of canceling the project and find a more skillful designer to work on the project. We are hugely delayed by their working style, but we don't know if we can cancel and request the refund for the escrow account that we set there. Thank you for your help!

I informed the freelancer, paid him his money in the form of bonus and so the job was completed successfuly. He even left me a good feedback. However, under payments and billing section I can still see that $60 is currently due. I think it's because I added his entire pay as bonus. I simply did not know how it's done, since this is the second time I hired a person and it's my first time hiring on an hourly contract (so things were slightly confusing for me).I got an email that failure of this due payment will result in a suspention. However my freelancer is already paid the full amount in the form of bonus. He already knows this.as I've notified him. Now, what should I do in this case?Regards,Shummas

	When to release payment?
","Apr 27, 2020  01:57:03 PM","
We hired a freelancer to build a wordpress website for around $2000.   We released the first half up front.  The website is now complete and she wants us to release the second half before she transfers the website to our wordpress hosting site.  My understanding is that we should release the payment only after we have the wordpress site in hand and verified that we are able to control and modify it.  However, she is insisting that we release payment before she transfers the website to us.  She said that if she fails to transfer the website after we release payment, we can open a dispute and get our money back, but Upwork support person told me that once we release payment, it is final, and recommended that we only release payment after the wordpress site has been delivered.  We are at a standstill.  Should we just release payment and hope everything goes OK, or should we follow Upwork's recommendation and release payment after receiving the website?  Is it standard to expect clients to release payment before the wordpress site is delivered?

	Freelancer situation
","Apr 27, 2020  01:00:33 PM","
Hello, First of all I am going to put things down in big lines. I hired a freelancer a few months back for a small job. The job was completed, and so was the payment. I was actually travelling while this happened, but I wasn't really concerned because I had one more prior experience with this particular freelancer and all went well previously. I managed to look at what he delivered after a while, the code and everything. Things seemed fine at a first glance and since this wasn't on a big hurry I put what was delivered aside. Then some more time passed, I was again travelling, then all the Corona thing happened and yeah. So after a couple of months, nowadays basically, I started putting things together, and at a closer look, I saw there was a functionality issue in what was delivered, basically something wasn't working.  I tried contacting the freelancer on Skype and on Upwork as well, mentioning about this particular issue and if he has some time to look at, since it wasn't a proper delivery. Haven't heard back at all and on my Upwork Messages and Files area this is what I got ""You can no longer message this user."", after I sent my messages. And he also saw the message I left on Skype, so that's that. I mean I was quite flexible when it came to this collaboration and I just don't get it. And even though he delivered this with the functionality issue, I actually wanted to solve it, and also give him a bonus, but he didn't even reply. So I just wanted to ask, is there anything that can be done at this stage? Or is it closed? I saw I can ask for a refund but I am more interested in solving the issue than in getting a refund. Thanks!

Hello, i do not know why there seems so hard to find a place to create a ticket or get some support which is why i've decided to also share those words with you about my experiece.I ordered a code from a guy called **edited for Community Guidelines** working here as a freelancer, the job was given may of 2019 and were a scraping service of online gaming.In the beginning he told me he could start right away without any further issues, fulltime since i was in a hurry.He worked and the program was left with bugs which he told me he would fix which was pretty solid from him.The time went on and everytime i reported 2 problems, he solved 1 at a time, always.In the end i shared my account with a IT-Developer which i know from long way back since i found it really hard to understand why and what he always was saying since im not into computers the same way **edited for Community Guidelines** probably was. Time went on and i pretty much relied on my friend to solve this with me but he always said that it seem'd like he answered what the problem was, but when he sent the fix it was never fixed. Time went on further and then i noticed i got this Auto-Reply when i tried to message him January 2020: **edited for Community Guidelines** does not currently have access to Upwork and will not receive messages until access is restored""In the end the code was not delivering what we agreed on from the start, its giving false data and im not able to change anything due to lack of coding experience which equals that the code that he delivered is not anything i can use at all.
 
I have been engrossed in work and have not had time with a person who neither answers nor tries to understand, but now the situation looks different. Since this is quite a lot of money, I wish I will get help from Upwork, probably it has probably ""gone too long"", ""You have already accepted the terms"" or something like that, but no matter what I want to share my journey here at Upwork and probably make you think twice before you order. 
Since i found it so hard to find any relevant place to explain and share about this in order to get support i will keep this thread updated with every response i get from the Upwork support team.Do anyone here had the same issue as me and know what i could do about this?Sincerely, Daniel

Except this, I changed my account email from **Edited for Community Guidelines**
Looking forward to your early reply 
 
In order to ask support, I have to create another Upwork account, or I am not able to do that. I have to say it is really hard to contact your support.
 
Thank you!

	Refund Request - Dishonest Freelancer / Platform Dispute & Support Tools Unexistent
","Apr 15, 2020  09:19:18 AM","
Hi.
 
I have an issue because I ""hired"" a freelancer who did not do ANY work at all and still charged me for ""hours worked"" when she literally did nothing. I opened a contract and asked her not to log-in any hours until we started working, like actually doing something. After this, I wrote to her so that we could provide her with training and instructions. Of course, training counts as time - but the thing is she responded poorly, so we didn't even get the chance to conduct training - that's how bad she was. Because she was responding poorly, and her rough English on the 5-message-exchange we had was so poor - I canceled the contract. She still billed me $47 dollars, for not moving a finger.
 
I requested the refund from her - but of course, she's not responding. She has not cared to respond. Whats more - upwork's ""support"" is ridiculous. Where's the option to file a complaint? To talk to someone who can help? To call? Your guidelines state there's an option to file a dispute. Yet please see my screenshot - there's no option to place a dispute. I'm sending screengrabs.
 
I'm looking for a solution; because it's really incredible that someone who does not move a finger charges you for work not done. She basically charged me for ""accepting the contract"", there's no other way to look at it.
 
I want a solution, and I want my money back. This is completely disrespectful in every single way - not to mention that Upwork does not have the tools for people to dispute these claims, or at least I don't. Ridiculous.

	About this Freelancer- *edited*
","Apr 22, 2020  03:47:02 PM","
So, I had hired this freelancer **edited for Community Guidelines**  to design my game box. She did a good job and I was perfectly fine with her. 
After that, I told her, if she can do me an extra favour to check previous related work and just let me know the sizes of my game cards. I didn't ask for any design work...just to let me know the sizes as I do not have any photoshop software. 
She refused to do it. 
I told her, it's a less than 10 mins job. I was really expecting you to help me and for doing this extra work, I would have been grateful to you and most probably would have hired you for another design work. But she refused and said, we don't do free work. I said, okay fine, but I was really expecting this small favour from you, all right, we won't see each other again and I won't give you any more tasks. I had NEVER said that I won't pay her for her design work or I would delay payment etc. In fact, I paid her right away, after that conversation. I also gave her a good rating. 
But now, see what she wrote about me- 
 
BE AWARE of WORKING WITH THIS CLIENT. MAY FORCE YOU FOR FREE WORK. I WILL REPORT THIS TO UPWORK FOR SURE""
 
I didn't FORCE her anything even for once. 
Tell me how do I complain about this freelancer?

	Freelancer plays on Facebook for 20+ hours, I open a dispute, she retaliates with a 3 star review
","Apr 21, 2020  09:20:03 PM","
This is making me want to pull my hair out.  I hadn't requested any work from this freelancer for a while. One day, out of the blue, I was reviewing my bank statement and realized I was getting invoices from Upwork. So I sign in and see that my freelancer I had a contract with has been charging me hours, despite not having assigned any work for her. I look at the work diary screenshots and it's literally just her scrolling through Facebook for hours on end while the clock was running. I of course open a dispute, she ends the contract. She says in the dispute ""I don't have any money right now, so I can't refund you. Hopefully we can work this out some other way."" So she just expected to work for me as compensation after she scammed me? Uh, no. I think her plan was to play this sympathy card and for me to not to pursue the dispute. I win two disputes for two weeks (still working on the third week scammed). I missed the review window (partially because I was waiting for the third week to be refunded, but it's taking forever because I'm having to go thru this manual process because you can only open formal disputes for the last week). And then I see that she leaves me a 3 star review. No comments written on her end explaining why-- just 3 stars.  So she scams me, asks for me to work with her as compensation, and then when I don't want to work with an untrustworthy person and pursue/win two disputes, she retaliates with a 3 star review. If this isn't a case where a review should be removed since it's clear retaliation, I don't know what is. Yet the support person I'm talking to right now for the manual third dispute is hemming and hawing on this. Any advice on getting this feedback removed?

	I've been billed excessively on hourly rate without completing the tasks on the contract.
","Apr 21, 2020  06:28:18 PM","
I posted a job on upwork few months ago to enhance my App. IOS, Android, Backend. I listed the major tasks and who can apply to this job, Expert level only.Some freelancer from India had great proposal saying all  issues are fixable and guaranteed. So he quoted me 384hrs to do the entire project. I hired him and we had a contract not to exceed the 384hrs and to cover whats listed in the contract. The freelancer said in his statement if we come close to this amount of hours without completing the project he will pause upwork timer! The second week after handling the source code to him, major issues not fixed and until this moment the major tasks listed on the contract still not completed. Every other week started discovering this freelancer is not an Expert level,  PLUS who is working on my project I don’t know him and never existed in group. Many basic features and functions it’s his time doing it! like in-app purchase... upwork dairy screenshots shows he was looking it up how to implement it.The time come so close to 384hrs so I paused the upwork timer... freelancer went crazy saying that he doesn’t work without active billing. I filed dispute and attached all the screenshots, proofs, my statements along with the contract. Pretty much I've been scammed, lack of experience and lack of progress. The freelancer stole the source code in legit way and abused the upwork timer by dual monitor setup on his computer, God knows what was going in the sec monitor, Netflix or maybe other projects.My request to the dispute team to refund all my money and take a serious action toward his account.Has anyone been through similar to this hassle?

	B2B Sales During the Pandemic
","Apr 18, 2020  02:17:20 PM","
This is posted in Clients because they are infinitely more likely to be engaged in B2B sales than are freelancers, and in the end most freelance work supports a B2B/C sale. It is impossible to sell an unlimited benefit at zero cost to a customer whose hair is on fire, knows that the solution is XYZ, and until he hears XYZ, cannot hear what you are saying. There is a partial fix; it is never quick, and often fails. Other approaches not including kidnapping usually fail more often. Agree with him. Say “XYZ.” That wasn’t hard, was it? Now, you’ve got him engaged. He will probably be too surprised to shut you down. Avoid, “Yeah, but,” because but negates yeah. Use “and.” Agree, don’t argue, never contradict, just “and.” As long as he’s engaged, you’re making progress. You’re expanding his frame of reference. This is not an instant solution. If the sale is important, success is getting a second appointment. If your success is only a signed contract, just skip the preliminaries and go bankrupt. This is not easy to do. It cannot possibly save millions of small businesses. It will fail for B2C sales in nearly all cases. It does work, but takes both patience and practice. Rarely is it a one-step process. The first time you use it you will probably fail. The two hundredth time it might be a fifty-fifty proposition. Let the client be emotional, your role is agreement and empathy. The good news is that you have lots of chances to practice every day. You bump into someone in a grocery, he calls you A Nasty Name. Agree. “Yes, I’m A Nasty Name.” Short-circuits confrontation. Agree with your critics, use and; eventually you have a chance at progress. This will not salvage a single freelancer. It can help clients, who can help salvage freelancers. You already know that the second worst outcome is losing an argument with a client; the worst outcome is winning. This approach applies the same principles. Yes, every criticism of this is correct.

	Upwork -Give a space to dispute freelancer Fraud
","Apr 17, 2020  08:45:03 AM","
I started a project with a certian company in India, due to the time differences it was very difficult to communicate and find the time when the specific team members were present. The milestone times were extended as mutually agreed as communication was difficult between the parties for time differences. The freelancer **Edited for community guidelines** was not contactable as it was night for her in India and someone else always answered.
So much confusion and lack of understanding of the project after the first discussion milestone, which they charged 300 dollars for
The second milestone was like fair amount of work, the only problem was unless I activated the second milestone and payment was made they wouldnt do the work. So I approved the second mileston, so all in all we paid 950 dollars, and at the end of it, they were only able to show us some screenshots, and they haven't understood the concept at all. Then our team met with some funders and wanted few changes made. They said they couldn't do it, cos it is out of scope. Then we requested them to refund most of the funds and keep about $250 for their time and screenshots developed they refused to refund saying the milestone was delivered.
The worst is when upwork has a rule within 5 days of payment you have to refute it, It is not fair, it should be payment must be able to refute if the milestone was not successfully completed.
This is day light robbery, upwork should monitor this kind of freelancers and act as an intermediary to hard earn money being robbed this way by freelancer.The freelancers name is **Edited for community guidelines** , half the time she was not contactable and someone else spoke on her behalf from india. I am going to dispute this payment with my credit card company

	Paid in wrong currency
","Apr 15, 2020  12:04:26 AM","
Hello, I am in Australia and posted my first job with a fixed price of $100. I didn't see any currency specified in any of the screens and assumed it was Australian Dollars. I reached out to one of the freelancers who'd given a proposal for $150, still assuming it was Australian dollars. The freelancer and I started discussing the parameters of the job and in the process he provided work by private message. All before I had accepted his offer. When it came to 'hire' this freelancer and accept his offer Upwork charged me in US Dollars. An amount which was nearly double what I was expecting due to exchange rate conversion. I was shocked! Nowhere throughout the process on any screen had it said US Dollars. I changed my offer to the equiavalent AUD amount of $150 in line with my expectations. The freelancer is now upset that he isn't getting paid what he expected. I am upset that I was grossly overcharged and honestly can't afford that amount for the project. I went to take this up with Upwork directly but can't find any person to help. I feel I was misled by the currency not being made clear by Upwork. Can anyone give advice on how to go about this?

I recently requested a freelancer to give me customized recommendations to increase traffic to a Kickstarter page. Her recommendations are nothing more than easily accessible information from a quick web search. Her work diary shows her completing the entire deliverable non-stop from start to finish without a single ounce of research besides looking at my Kickstarter page. I tried disputing her hours on Upwork, but I can only dispute whether she put in the hours, and not the quality of those hours. I asked, just in case, in a call whether she would be adapting a template and she explicitly stated she wouldn't be. All evidence points to her adapting a template. This goes beyond disputing quality of work because it's not of matter of poor or well-done work, it's blatantly false. How can I dispute this?

So she rejected my ""escrow refund request"". Me and the freelancer both agreed that $40 would solve the problem, but Upwork doesn't give me the choice to do so... it's so frustrating... and they only have a chat bot that gives you no helpful answer. Has anyone been through this? Thank you everyone!!

	How to edit my account's first/last name when using Google Sign-in
","Apr 14, 2020  11:45:22 AM","
Hi community team, I use Google Sign-in for my account. I would lke to edit my account's first/last name when using Google Sign-in. In particular, I'd like to change mya ccount to just the last initial. The rationale for this is to maintain some anonymity with prospective freelancers, who in many cases I'm finding are Googling me / connecting on LinkedIn before we have a business relationship. That's all good and fine, but it's too much, too soon. I can't seem to edit the account settings at all; it requires a real password to edit, but I don't have a password because I use Google Sign-in and I can't seem to find a way to add a password or associate a regular account. Automated help is not helpful in this case and I cannot find an actual ticket queue or support mechanism at UpWork, so here I am in the community . I would be grateful for any guidance. Thank you!

	Misleading Job offers from Companies
","Apr 13, 2020  02:07:51 PM","
I would like to bring this topic since in two opportunities I have replied to two job postings for freelancer translations to ads that originally appeared to come from an individual seeking basic translations (Spanish/English). When I received the response that my proposal was accepted, they sent me a file with a position duties profile for a full time position with a lengthy description of responsibilities (??) also found out that this company required me to undergo an online interview process with a HR Manager.  Personally I found this to be a scam. It is a way to mislead someone to respond an Ad and to obtain people to apply for long term positions.  I am a Freelancer, my intentions is to work independendly nor for a company that it is using Upwork and publishing misleading or sketchy jobs opportunities.  Now, I had to withdraw my proposal and loose my connects/money for a second time. I am attaching the response I received from two companies, that initially the description job published in Upwork was totatlly different for what they intended to.I wonder how Upwork is letting this companies to advertise misleading freelance jobs and make people loose money.  
I hope Upwork give us an explanation about this issue.

	How long does email verification take?
","Apr 12, 2020  02:12:30 PM","
I signed up under my business email which is a redirect to Gmail. I know the redirect works because I tried doing a test send to it. Are you allowed to use an email redirect or does the email have to be directly to that actual mailbox? The reason for me testing my email was because Upwork has not sent me my verification email yet. Does it sometimes take a while?

	Increase Daily Invitation Limit Of Freelancers
","Apr 9, 2020  11:12:43 AM","
Hey there,I am running a small publishing company and need to fill a lot of positions currently.Using a featured job gives me the opportunity to invite an unlimited amount of freelancers.But, there is a daily limit of around 50-70 people I can invite. After I invite this number of people, I am able to request an exception to this limit, but this function is not working at all.I know from a friend that he's able to invite as many freelancers as he likes to on a daily basis. When he started on Upwork, he could request exceptions several times until there was no limit at all after a certain period.I already contacted the support and they told me that turning a job post to private disables this daily limit, but it's also not working.My selection process is quite strict. Considering my hiring statistics from my current job, I know that I need to invite around 100 people to find one suited candidate. It would take me weeks to fill all positions because I need to hire 30-50 writers currently.Therefore, this feature is crucial for me.Best Regards, Christoph

	Addings funds to an existing, fixed-rate contract
","Apr 7, 2020  07:26:44 AM","
Is it possible to add funds to an existing, fixed-rate contract? The software development process is far more complex than the Contractor estimated.  Moreover, suggestions are being made, along the way and features are being added, making the product much better and more expensive than originally anticipated.   There's still a substantial amount of work to be done before the software is commercially viable, including a ""pilot phase.""  If that work isn't completed properly, I won't be able to use any of the features, already developed and paid for;  so, I don't want to close the contract and rate the contractor prematurely, i.e.,  before all of the work is done. I understand I can pause the contract for 75 days and start a second contract.  I prefer not to do that, though; since it may take more than 75 days to complete all of the work properly and pilot the software.  It would be far simpler to add funds to the existing contract.  Thank you!

	Hiring a Data Entry Professional
","Feb 3, 2017  06:24:32 AM","
Data entry professionals analyze data and enter it into spreadsheets or content management systems. Many professionals have additional training and certifications for specialized projects like medical transcription or paralegal research.
 
If you’re looking to hire a data entry professional, an informative and detailed job description is the first step. Your job description should explain the work to be completed, including details like timelines, required industry knowledge, the types of software being used, and the overall expectations. The more details provided up front, the easier it is for skilled professionals to submit proposals.
 
Also, be sure to state the specific type of data entry that you need. For instance, if most of your data is numerical, then you’d want a professional who specializes in 10-key data entry. If documents will be scanned and transferred to spreadsheets, then you require a data entry specialist who’s familiar with those technologies.
 
We have several resources to help you find and vet a great data entry professional. Check out a Hiring Headquarter article here, which includes a sample project description. Another great resource is our Hiring Resource page which has sample interview questions.
 
Clients who have already hired in this field, is there anything you found beneficial to include in your job posts? Or a quality that stands out when hiring a freelancer in this category?

	Freelancer Requesting Personal Information - Tax Prep
","Apr 7, 2020  07:26:21 AM","
G'day, UpWork,  I'm new to the platform as a business owner; however, I understand the basics and have used similar platforms (i.e. Fiverr) for hire in the past. I'm confident that my question has obvious implications, but I cannot help but feel the need to seek your advice.  As a new business owner, I am currently considering hiring a freelancer to assist in preparing a couple of our tax documents. At this point, I have identified a freelancer who is willing to prepare these documents at a price that I am comfortable with; however, it didn't hit me until the freelancer requested personal information that I could be exposing our business and ourselves to undue risk. Obviously, the freelancer needs our financial documents and our personal information to prepare the documents, but should I share this information with a freelancer who hasn't completed many jobs? The freelancer is asking for our EIN and social security numbers. I should also mention that the freelancer stated early in our conversation that we should move off the platform as it would be ""easier."" I made it clear that I was uncomfortable with that, and the freelancer stated he we could continue using UpWork.  Can I please get some feedback here? Are there any safeguards for sharing personally identifiable information or am I simply taking a huge risk?  Thank you in advance! -Dusty

	Scam or just slow, I want a refund.
","Apr 4, 2020  05:48:56 PM","
I'm frustrated.  If you don't want a whiny long read, perhaps skip this, but I appreciate anyone who has had successes in getting a refund to reply. I have had good luck with Upwork freelancers in the past so this one is difficult.  I hired someone to combine information from 3 different sources -- two spreadsheets and a pdf.  It's for an e-commerce site and it is a couple of thousand products needing updates or additions so not exactly an overnight turnaround job.   I've done similar work myself for my site and I knew that it would have taken me between 20 and 30 hours to do the work in an inefficient way.  There are faster people and better ways -- I have hired others to do this kind of project and typically they do it in 4 to 10 hours.  The end product is a large spreadsheet that I upload to my website as a csv. So I turned to Upwork to find a freelancer.  I hired someone who in theory SHOULD have been able to do the work.  However, after 3-1/2 weeks of nothing (about 15 hours of work billed total) she had not produced anything but sent me a spreadsheet that was simply what you'd get if you had Adobe try to extract the particular PDF into a spreadsheet (5 minutes and an ugly result) and had her husband talk with me because it was HIM not her who would be doing the project. OK, this was a surprise but I didn't care -- I figured he had a reason not to have his own profile.  We had initially also linked up on FB and messenger and I had given her access to a Slack channel but with the problems I requested that she/he contact me only via Upwork until this initial project was done.So another week goes by and I push for communications/results and nada.  But she bills for 20 hours and I think maybe something's happening.  So I keep communicating, don't dispute her time (though I can see from screenshots that in middle of that 20 hours she has started randomly pulling up pages on my website that have nothing to do with her project) and then comes this last week where she bills 25 hours with no results.  I paused the contract and sent several requests for her to just send me what she has done to date. She first says ""I sent it in Slack/Dropbox"" and I tell her to provide the link here in Upwork.  No reply, no link. She says she'll send it in an hour.  That was DAYS ago.  I put the contract on hold on Wednesday (today is Saturday) and no responding from her to my queries. Now, I ping her saying ""I have to report to Upwork this problem"" if you don't give me SOMETHING, anything of the spreadsheet.  Nothing from her.    Then I request a refund and I get a ""I tried to call you on FB""  which she did not do -- my FB messenger has nothing from her.  So I came back with a screenshot of FB to her saying ""there's nothing there, please communicate on Upwork"" and she is just not replying at all here or anywhere. So this seems like a scam.  Maybe the husband (or boyfriend or brother...) is the guy doing the scam and she's just the front.  Maybe it's her but I am so frustrated because I've never paid anyone for so many hours w/o getting anything from them!    If she (or he) is just clueless, that is OK and we can work forward but this is just a brick wall. I requested a refund from her -- and see that went into the messages to her -- but don't know how the refund comes.  Does anyone here have a similar experience or understanding? Very frustrated.

I always wondered how these developers, get by the Upwork system, its possible they make legitimate users start accounts for them, then they take over accounts...im not sure whats solutions would be possible for such deceptive practices. Maybe IP login detected not from country of account...but i know how frustrating is can be when you get developers with fake profiles... when i try hiring some of them I always try and voice with them to confirm they are who they say they are...Maybe its just a price incentive to say you work from they usa when you do not...

Job Posting auto closed - no way to edit it, and won't let me create another post.
 
I have done probably close to $100,000 in business, or more on upwork since it was rentacoder and then elance, and now upwork.
 
I created a new account for a new project I'm doing since the funding is coming from a different source to keep it all clean financially. I asked in the post for the person interested in the job to open a spreadsheet, then open a single image file and draw a box around a power pole shown in the image.
 
A few seconds later, it auto-closed it on me.
I could no longer search on the post, so I couldn't change it.
I tried to create a new one, and didn't ask them to do anything to prove they could do the work, I just added questions asking them if they could open an image in paint and draw a box and open a spreadsheet and read a word from a column. But when I went to post it, it said it had already been posted, I couldn't save it either, it said the same thing. 
 
So I left the page, and searched all jobs again, but it didn't show up (no filters on, but it was just gone)
 
I needed to hire 20 people, and now I'm headed over to Fiverr, but I don't like fiverr as much. 
 
Can someone help me?
I went to the support page, and when I try to contact support, it opens the button as if I pressed the button on their auto answering bot. It's like the contact support and the datasolve chat bot buttons are both going to the same place.
 
If I can't get help quickly, I have no choice but to try fiverr for this isntead.
 
Any help here would be greatly appreciated,
 
Thanks

	Complaint: beware of **
","Apr 2, 2020  01:35:51 PM","
hi, I'm completely new to Upwork and thought I could get my first job done. I wanted to open up a dispute about the freelancer **Edited for Community Guidelines**. I'm not sure what I can get back from this but I want to prevent him from cheating someone else out of their money. He has a very good profile and reviews to match and my being naive accepted it and gave him the benefit of the doubt to do what he had to do to create my report. upon completion, a lot of flags were thrown but I ignored them. I hired a proofreader to go over the content. Turns out that she said it was completely horrible with so many errors. she said that it was ""lifted from something."" it was very very sloppy and the punctuation didn't make any sense nor does the formatting. Therefore, I would like to report **Edited for Community Guidelines** and let the people at Upwork know that he's basically a SCAMMER!  Please, if I can somehow get my money back that would be great, but if not, could I at least have his account banned so he doesn't do this to anybody else? Thanks!
 
I wasn't able to upload my word document to support my claims but if there's another way please let me know.

	How to change ""Pay by hourly"" into other method
","Mar 30, 2020  01:18:13 PM","
Hi Sir/Madam, I'm new in UPWORK. I have three questions: 1. Billing method, Can you tell me how to change hourly to word count?When I clicked ""Hire"" botton, the pay in only have two options: hourly or fixed price. But the pay of the voice job I posted here is based on word counts. I offered C$18 for each 1000 words. I've hired one talent today and both of us underdstand and agree that price is based on word count. Here is the problem, the hire in upwork now is hourly. There will be difference on amount I'll pay. 2. Credit Card / Debit Card / Currency Exchange RateI have filled in my billing information with my credit card. I'm contacting another freelancer who is in United States. So what currency will be deducted from my account, CAD OR USD? If it is USD, considering the exchange rate, and credit card fees, money paid by debit card or credit card which is cheaper? 3. Service Charge and Paypal ChargeI know there is 3% service charge by Upwork. For paypal, it is 4.4%+0.3. Are these two fees charged seperately? For example, if I pay CAD100 to a freelancer by Paypal, I also need pay CAD3.00 to Upwork, CAD4.4+0.3 to Paypal? Do I need to pay GHT or something? I need details on the costs to arrange my budget.  Your suggestion and quick response are highly appreciated. Thanks and Best Regars,Kris

	Releasing funds when I am not satisfied

I had fixed price project, I selected a freelancer, explained precisely what I want. Though I received wrong output - something else that I described. I requested to fix it and provided some samples. The freelancer did not interact and I solved my issue myself meanwhile. Now he asked me to release the funds. What shall I do now? He does not deserve the award. I would pay half, for his efforts. But it seems I cannot edit the contract. Is it possible? Another option is to release the funds as it is not much money anyway.  But I will worry to use Upwork next time because I will feel that being the client is a lottery as there is no protection. Is fiverr or elance better?

	Payments, escrows and confirmations
","Mar 27, 2020  06:07:24 PM","
When asked, I entered a credit card as a payment method to hire a freelancer.The credit card is not confirmed yet, since the bank statement doesn't have the entries yet. This might even happen after the weekend...Despite the fact that the credit card is not confirmed, Upwork did allow for the amount to be transferred to the escrow account!The freelancer has done the job and I want to pay him immediately.Obviously the unconfirmed credit card does not pay him until it is confirmed, despite the fact that it allowed for the money to be transfered to the escrow...I added a new  payment method, Paypal, which doesn't need confirmation.I tried to switch the payment method for the freelancer, from credit card to Paypal, but the system does not allow this.I am outraged because Upwork makes me look ""unreliable"" when it is 100% their mistake:1. Why on earth would they charge the escrow amount if the card was not approved yet? What if I were a crook and chose not to ever ""confirm"" it?2. Why didn't Upwork at least notify me before charging for the escrow that this would happen so that I choose a different payment method in the first place? 3. Why on earth am I not allowed to switch payment method now to pay my freelancer immediately? This is a complaint.

	Clients to Remember to Close Their Jobs
","Mar 24, 2020  10:41:55 AM","
I recently heard that connects are now refunded once the job you had applied for closes. I would like to suggest something else too. As a new freelancer, I try to apply to new projects that fit within my expertise. However, after a while, I find out I have used all my connects to apply to projects as old as 20+ days. I can no longer apply to other jobs because I lack connects even though the clients who posted the jobs had been online and they chose someone else to work for them instead of myself.  Now I know they don't want me to work for them due to whatever reason, but I am still not refunded my connects because according to the system, the job is still open and I have applied, but I am not accepted. It would be great to set up a system somehow to get a client to refuse a freelancer thereby closing the job for just that freelancer so that he is refunded the connects. Or the clients could be reminded through a reminder-email to close their job once someone is hired, so that the rest of us can continue. Just my two cents and I am not sure if this is the right place to post this, but it's a start. It would be great if something can be done about this.

Hello, A few days ago, i hired a freelancer to do some writing work for me about a certain topic. However, when i checked his delivered work, not exaggerating here, it was horrible and it showed that he know nothing about what he was writing, no understanding or research whatsoever. When i explained to him that i wasn't satisfied about the quality, i gave him another chance and delivered once again but with no significant improvement. I just can't use the material he delivered. From what he told me, he is outsourcing the work to someone else, who is apparently doing a lousy job, apparently, he is not a writer himself. Currently, our contract is a fixed price with 1 milestone, that i still haven't approved. My question is, can i request a refund in this kind of circumstance? Thank you for your guidance!

But until today, my bankstatement show no activities of this transaction and the person I tried to hire , still does not have the 'Status' Hired.

 I hired someone to make a Javascript program that searches the Amazon API for pricing. The freelancer created a script and it runs and returns pricing. I paid him and left him feedback because I saw the script work. I don't know code though. However, I sent the script to another freelancer to do the next part of the project and he told me that the guy isn't even querying the Amazon API. He's querying his own site!!! My script is worthless if his site goes down, he decides to delete it, etc... How in the world do I get my money back?

	Freelancer takes job, Waste months of time and goes offline and not responding

Hi,I am having some issues with one of a freelancer on other similar platform who is also working on Upwork.He has taken the project and not delivered and also not responding to my messages and also to the freelancer.com support team. he is gone offline there. but I can see him online on this platform.It looks like he has manners and seriousness about work. I just need you guys to remind him of his responsibilities.He has taken a project with 10 days limits, it's over 3 months now no complete project submitted, sometimes given app for testing with many bugs just keep asking for more time to fix them. In the end I just ask to handover the project in whatever state it is now and get paid for what work you have done but also not responding to that. Yes, I am having the option to end the project via freelancers' support but that will not give me back my time which this freelancer wasted so I need to get the project to continue the work instead of starting from scratch.I have validated that the profile on both platform is of same person.

	Rude Freelancer / Copyright Issue
","Mar 13, 2020  07:57:14 PM","
I am not certain how to properly report a freelancer to UpWork, but I have an issue with my latest one. This gentleman was hired to perform ghostwriting for me. The specifics of the project were that I would pay at three milestones: first draft, second draft, final draft. My freelancer was very late on the first draft then offered several revised dates, and missed those as well. He finally delivered the first draft weeks after my set schedule, and then 3 days later demanded payment for the draft (which was actually incomplete) as well as for the 2nd and final drafts, which is work he never did. He offered to sever the contract after the first draft, so I paid him for the first milestone and cancelled the remainder. Needless to say, I did not leave a flattering review although it was fair and honest. He retaliated by sending me a message stating that he had filed a Copyright on the work that he had authored for me. IP concerns aside, this is Extraordinarily unprofessional behavior and should not be tolerated by the UpWork community. I don't know who to speak to, so I am speaking to this group in hopes that someone can guide me on how to properly deal with this issue in within UpWork.

I am a small startup and I really care about the quality of the people who work for me. I recruited a frontend developper last month and coached him on how to do the job correctly. She now understands the business, she built the website and she was good. When we got close to the end of the contract and the release of the website, Upwork just sends me an email to abruptly terminate my contract with the freelancer because of some violation I do not really care about.... Upwork is supposed to help me get my job done fast but now they ruined my schedule and possibly the existence of my small business as I am just starting. The workforce of a company is crucial to its existence. How can you guys just remove my employees as you see fit without even a notice... That's really bad and I am really angry right now

	Beware this Freelancer is a Fraud

I already flagged this user days ago, and complained to Upwork but not sure why his profile is still up even though I received an email from Upwork that action was taken.

A fraud from China using multiple freelancer accounts to bid and scam clients (unfortunately I was a victim and lost my money).
 
This particular profile claims to be from India but he was caught when I called him on Skype. He ultimately gave in and told me he's paying 10% to people to create, verify and provide him the account.I even doubt he's from China.I've sent screenshots of Skype convo to support as well.

The upwork team said that it will take 4 business days.Though passed 4 days, I can't see the result.What can I do?

	Chinese applicants posing as Europeans.
","Jul 23, 2015  10:03:30 AM","
I have run into this several times now where Chinese freelancers will build fake profiles to appear as Europeans and have gotten pretty good at eliminating this as a risk. Bottom line is, If I require a western freelancer (usually for english fluency or timezone more than anything else) ... I insist on meeting in skype for a chat, and then a video call. If they give excuses (no video camera) ... or if their written english in chat is 'off' ... I move on. I wonder though... if there is a way that UpWork can help to prevent this type of fraudulent behavior ... by removing profiles that claim European location ... but are logged in from obvious Chinese IP addresses? This would help to reduce the amount of time required to interview these folks and find out that they are not who they say they are.

	Freelancer billed me for 30 unauthorized hours
","Mar 9, 2020  09:46:51 PM","
Hi there,
 
I'm not sure what recourse I have other than posting here.
 
I've hired through Upwork for years and had generally ok to good experiences. But this was the first time I felt straight up defrauded.
 
The freelancer, **edited for Community Guidelines**, was doing gmail admin work. I set the limit to 10 hours a week since it was there were a half hour here and there over the course of a few weeks. I employ several other people for 1-2 years so I don't look at payroll every week. My bad, of course. But that still did not give license for them to bill me for 10 hours a week for 3 weeks - no work done, absurd excuse that I had awarded them a maintenance contract (no record of that in our chat).
 
I tried to work it out with them. They stopped responding so I left a review. Now they've removed that review. It's crazy because it wasn't just bad work - it was stealing and then refusing to return the money. 
 
How can future clients know that this guy does this? It seems irresponsible to completely remove that feedback given the circumstance.

	SUGGESTION: Standard Upwork non-disclosure agreement
","Mar 8, 2020  09:46:23 AM","
So many prospective clients need to protect their intellectual property before providing details to the freelancers quoting their job.  I believe Upwork should provide a standard NDA checkbox on the client job posting form.  Clients:By selecting the checkbox the client has agreed to terms protecting the freelancer from frivolous or vindictive accusations.  Upwork:Upwork must strictly adhere to a ""presumption of innocence"" principle regarding freelancers. Claims must not affect the freelancers Upwork status on unless a breach is ruled in a court of law.Upwork's only responsibility is to provide the means for a record of agreement between client and freelancer. It is not Upwork's responsibility to enforce or otherwise service the NDA,  Freelancer:A corresponding checkbox will appear on the proposal submission page if the client has selected it when posting the job. A submission cannot be submitted without agreeing to the NDA and selecting the checkbox.  The language of the agreement should be straightforward and easy to read, a simple agreement that the freelancer will make every possible effort to protect the intellectual property of the client, and be responsible for damages should the clients property be revealed by the freelancer as determined by a court of law. The client also agrees not to hold the freelancer responsible should the intellectual property become publicly known through no fault of the freelancer. The client also agrees should a claim be raised and found to be without merit in a court of law, the client is responsible for all leagal costs and damages upon the freelancer.

Freelancer wanted upfront payment. Freelancer didnt meet deadline / I gave him a time to submit the work he didnt sent me anything. I requested 2 times refund total mount of 200$. He declined. Wanted me to recontact and pay 200$ for nothing! Already asked him in chat, and here is chat conversation between me and him..
**Edited for Community Guidelines**Project cancellation - freelancer didnt meet deadline / and here is no work
**Edited for Community Guidelines**
 
Milestone is released and refund requested more than 2 times. Deadline is over, and he didnt send me anything to test. This is not what I agreed upon. I want my money back!
 
Then created a Dispute. Which ended like this;
**freelancer's name**, as you have failed to participate in dispute assistance where you have received payment, your account is now permanently suspended.
Upwork understands that a dispute with another member can be a disappointing and frustrating experience. However, it is always our goal to have a productive and interactive discussion so that both parties can come away with a positive experience, and we appreciate your time and efforts.
Have a beautiful weekend ahead.
 
 
And now I checked  my chat with Freelancer. He sended something ""Java Image Processing Image editor code"" and this is not what I requested. Is this really this easy to steal money on upwork? register as freelancer and request upfront payment and keep sending junk files to a client? I want my money back.

	Got cheated by a freelancer.. what do I do?
","Feb 19, 2019  12:23:19 AM","
I'm new to upwork and feel like I've been taken advantage of. I posted an ad seeking a telemarketer, they initially bidded at $15/hour... we negotiated through conversation and they agreed to $8/hour. Following this, I provided them with the username and password to my telemarketing software with over 50,000 phone numbers. They finished a bit of work and logged their hours (As it was on a pay per hour structure). I paid them and trusted that they logged it correctly, even gave them a REALLY POSITIVE REVIEW... but, they logged it with the $15/hr structure. I then messaged them that I wasn't happy about this, and that they should rightfully put in the work hours equivalent to our understanding of $8/hr. They agreed that it would be the right thing to do... but prior to doing those hours of work, she wanted me to sign up a new contract. They then logged into the software and deleted all 50,000 phone numbers in my telemarketing program.  There's over $500 in damages because of this. Seeking advice please.

	Upwork getting flooded with fake freelancer profiles
","Oct 8, 2016  04:25:14 AM","
What's up with Upwork getting flooded with fake freelancer profiles?! There used to be some in the past, but now it's getting flooded with profiles stating they're based in North America, stating ludicrous credentials (such as Harvard education, which of course they can't prove) when their writing reveals it's obviously not true. Not to mention the fake profile pictures stolen from stock photography sites. It's becoming a serious waste of time sifting through these profiles. I wish Upwork would come up with a more efficient method of reporting these - right now I have to open a support ticket and describe why I believe it's a fake profile. And on top of that Upwork doesn't seem to impose any sanctions on these profiles as they continue being live.Bottom line is - fake freelancer profiles are at the very minimum a waste of the client's time.When I state I want to work with someone from North America with English being their native language I have a reason for that - I don't need to waste my time wondering whether the freelancers Upwork shows me are truly meeting these criteria or not.

","Feb 23, 2020  09:50:45 AM","
After reorganization of services available to clients and the introduction of new membership tiers for client accounts, clients were limted to 3 three invites that they could send to freelancers.For the job I posted today, I am being offered 15 invites. I double-checked and I could see that I didn't buy a ""premium"" job post, nor am I in a paid client tier. My client membership tier is basic (free). If Upwork has increased the number of invites that clients can send from 3 to 15... then that's a good thing, as far as I am concerned. I like it as a freelancer because I think many clients prefer to have a larger number. So I see this as something that helps improve cient satisfaction with the platform.

I hired a freelancer with excellent credentials and who claims to live within my state to do some mods on my site.   The mods went well.  I asked him if he could do SEO and he said yes.   He then asked me if I could pay him through Paypal due to a financial emergency.   (Up until this point, he had been paid through Upwork.)   I thought it was fishy but, because his work to this point had been very good and because I wanted to help him out, I reluctantly agreed.   I said I would pay him in installments as the work was completed.   I paid him the first installment.   The following day, my site went down and I simultaneously received an email from an unknown person claiming that he had been hired by my freelancer to work on the SEO but had not been paid.    The freelancer denies having subbed out the work and claims that he was hacked.  However, the hacker sent me screen shots of a ""work log"" to prove that he was hired by my freelancer.  Freelancer expresses no remorse whatsoeover for what happened.    He says he wants to fix it, but I no longer trust him.   He says he doesn't care if I give him a bad review on Upwork.    Any advice?

The website was a mess - it was nothing like the design. After lots of changes and late night to get the website at least live. It was a piece of **Edited for Community Guidelines**and it kept breaking as well as being hacked none stop because of her code and not securing properly. I gave her a fair review but she agve me a whole story about feeding her daughter and how she would fix the site so begged me to change the review. I did. 
 
She then charged me more to maintain the site because it kept breaking all the time and my client could use it as it was all raw code and not the wordpress cms she had sold me. 
 
I have had to get another developer to rebuild the website as it was such an important project to me. It has cose me so much money and time and my reputation.

	Need to pause contract due to illness but unresponsive contractor
","Feb 19, 2020  01:27:53 PM","
I am very ill with a series condition and have been signed up for a hourly based contract based upon milestones for certain hours. The contractor has failed to make the functions for the number of hours and I had to put the contract on pause. In the meantime, while I try to figure out what my next step is he is continuing to work and not acknowledging the fact that I'm not feeling well and need to take some time to heal. All work has been considered manual hours of which I did not get a letter till after I started the contract. This is alarming and before things get out of hand I need to ask or speak with someone that has some ideas on how to handle the situation. If I wasn't sick I would be able to think better but I've been very clear about this and the contractor just does not want to hear it and just wants to plow ahead on his own terms according to the previous set stages – status reset because as most of us clients need milestones and make sure that certain jobs are completed at certain times. The deliverables are now way outside the scope of work and I need some assistance ASAP but can't get through to anyone on the company site. Any and all help others welcomed.

Hi, I had hired a freelancer for my project who seemed okay at first. We chat back and forth and he even agreed on the date of the shooting (it was a videography project). However, when I hired him, which means that I had to put a deposit to my escrow account (I was charged on my credit card already), he then asked for a raise. Then I finally agreed to the number he asked eventhough it's 33% higher than my offer (just to save from hassle), but then he asked for another raise because Upwork will deduct some charges from the written fee and he wants a clean number. So I withdrawn the offer, and now I need to withdraw the deposit I already put on my deposit. An article said that I should just Go to My Jobs to locate the contractClick the (...) options menu and select End contractChoose Pay nothing and request a refund or Pay another amount when ending the contractBut I can't find ""End contract"" on My Jobs.  Please help.   Thank you!

	Getting trouble in hiring freelancers
","Feb 23, 2020  05:01:51 PM","
I am getting trouble in hiring feelancers. Since I joined in Upwork, I posted 3 jobs but only one of them has been accomplished. The freelancer for the first job didn't send the result even yet and I can't find him, anymore. And my last project is paused without any reason. My freelancer said that his account encounters problems and I need to contact Upwork Customer Support. As I am new to Upwork, I have no experience. Please someone help me. I want to solve this issue asap. My project is really urgent and I am looking forward to removing the issues on my freelancer's account and moving forward with my project.

	Unreasonable suspension of freelancer (and freelancer's agency) by Upwork
","Feb 20, 2020  05:21:56 AM","
I have had an extremely frustrating experience dealing with Upwork regarding a freelancer who I would like to hire. The freelancer's account was suspended after Upwork claimed that the freelancer breached the Upwork Terms of Service by uploading a false identification. However, I have met the freelancer in person and have seen the ID that he uploaded to Upwork and have verified that the ID is authentic.
 
I have complained to Upwork about this and so has the freelancer but Upwork keeps on providing us with the same response stating that ""Our decision is final"". The freelancer has many positive ratings on Upwork and has spent over 3000 of hours building up its profile and reputation on Upwork. It completed 99 jobs and has been a member since 2004. The agency that the freelancer is owner of has also been suspended as part of this - that agency has spent over 11,000 hours on Upwork.
 
It's completely unreasonable for Upwork to conduct itself in this manner. It is destroying a freelancer's business through no fault of the freelancer at all.
 
The profile in question is **Edited for Community Guidelines**  and the agency is **Edited for Community Guidelines** .
 
The last email I received from Upwork states:

	How to add the witholding tax to invoice from upwork
","Feb 21, 2020  10:47:44 AM","
Hello,I am from EU hiring freelancer from India. I have to pay 30% witholding tax to my country. (double taxation avoidance bilateral agreement) So, the freelancer will get 70%, I will pay 30% to tax office and on invoice from upwork needs to be 100%. How do I set it up? Example: freelancer hourly rate is say 20$/hour, he worked 100hour and will get 2000$ (70%) (ok, upwork will deduct some fees from him) and on invoice needs to be 2857.15$ (100%) which is the real cost. How do I do that? Any advice?Thanks Roman

This has happened at least twice in the last week and honestly, is super frustrating. I don't have time to keep going back into messages to make sure that the notes and attachments I sent in the milestone are actually sent. And now I don't remember what notes I sent to that freelancer.  Also - the fact that I can't talk to someone in support about this is absolutely ludicrous. I understand we're not the biggest spender on this platform, but we spend a considerable amount of our freelance work through UpWork - more than on Fiverr or any other platform.  Please advise.

Hi Team, I am not asking this as a freelancer. I supply work most of the time, mostly longterm work for different client of mine for the past 3 years. In one of my recent job ads, one of the Freelancer whom seemed to be a good talent suddenly got withdrawn from the application, I saw .... does not currently have access to Upwork and will not receive messages until access is restored  In the chat I wonder if it was my fault. I always supply the project in a Test GitLab Repo and Trello for all the brief, charts and tasks. Then I ask candidates to get the project on their machine, read the code and see if they can do it. I ask them to supply me with 1 highlevel paragraph on a solution `no code` is needed and `no details` needed.I sometimes give them a sample response too:I would approach this problem by requesting the GraphQL mutation and analyse and cache the result....Now what lib thye would use or how they structre the call or how they cache it is the details that I don't need for awarding the job. Could that developer got into trouble because I asked for his GitLab and Trello ID? The other devs who applied and gave me their GitLab and Trello ID and responsed to the project not being banned from the project and I haven't gotten any notice though. I just don't want to be the cause of this. Please let me know if my approach is ok or if I need to change it on how I would ask dev to evaluate the code before commit to the project.

	Fixed price project - Unresponsive freelancer. How do I get my money back?
","Feb 14, 2020  09:15:06 AM","
I posted a fixed price project back in April for the development of a website and two mobile application (IOS + Android) in which the project was supposed to be completed six months later in September. Through this process, we implemented 12 milestones in which certain phases of the project would be completed, however this being development work, no tangible product would be delivered until the completion of the project ie. website and mobile source code and turning on the applications. Fast forward six months and the website is not yet completed, nor have the mobile apps been worked on. After passing several milestones of design and development work and giving the freelancer several thousand dollars all while passing me around to several new project managers and developers, he has gone silent for more than two months now. 
 
Keep in mind I've filed several disputes with Upwork over the last couple of months having Upwork reach out to the freelances with no response. 
 
I've attempted to ping him on all the chat features we've used, Upwork, Skype, Trello etc. and no response. I did, however, message the live chat feature on their website and got a response immediately from a gentleman in his office in which he said he would check on the project. After a few days with no response using the same method of their online chat, I received a response from the same gentleman who said the project would be completed in fifteen days. fifteen days later still no project or update.
 
In the meantime, I was able to get ahold of someone from the company I had been working with on the project in which they said that they had left the company because it was being run poorly and having financial trouble in which he never got paid for the last of his work with them.
 
fast forward another month and I finally receive a message from the original freelance. 
 
**Edited for Community Guidelines**
 
After seeing this I asked for an updated timeline in which he responded it would take another month for the website - I then asked about the mobile apps in which I received no response. It's now been several days later and still no response. 
 
At this point, the project is more than five months overdue and I can no longer wait on him, nor trust what he's saying and simply have to move on. Its been more than 30 days since paying for the last milestone, so arbitration is not an option. I'm thinking right now a chargeback through my bank is my only option - I know this against Upwork's policy, but I have no other options unless someone on this form has additional suggestions in which I'd be grateful.

AnywayI asked my partner to create her own account where he posted a job ""Find a local office in Madagascar"" - NOT RELATED TO BETTING AT ALL.And they blocked her! She used her own laptop, own debit card, own ip and somehow still got blocked.Why did you block her?! She is a completely different person that created a job not affiliated with betting whatsoever.Moreover, the money has been taken from her card a few seconds before suspension

So this is odd. A freelancer applied to a job I posted, and I cannot review their profile to see if they have the expertise necessary because when I click on them it says their profile is set to private, but I can still invite them to apply or hire them.  I thought when someone submits a proposal to a job that regardless of profile setting, the client can see the profile.

I sent her a couple follow up messages simply to check for instructions as the project is hourly, but I don't have the required information from client's side to start working. So, since she has specified that the project will be for 40hrs / week, should I wait for her to respond back to me before applying for another project?

Hi there, is there a way to ban someone from communicating with me? Despite best intentions on both sides - sometimes jobs end unsatisfactory.

	Very deep trouble
","Feb 9, 2020  02:34:40 AM","
Hi,I hired a **Edited for Community Guidelines** developer last year for a mailchimp small job. After he was paid he convinced me to continue working with him independently of Upwork, initially on what’s app and then Skype and email. He explained why (something to do with upwork taking his money etc) and I stupidly believed him. He did a few jobs since then, enough to convince me to agree to him Re building my website and my partners website. On the last Skype one of his ‘team’ a young girl joined us as his ‘designer’ - my partner pain him upfront to get a new website (he is recovering from a heart attack so he just wanted to job done fast as agreed) the developer has not been contactable for a week despite many many attempts. We contacted the girl and she seemed to be working for nothing for him, he owes her money and I have paid him a third for my new website. He has taken €630 from my partner and €250 from me with PayPal. He has the passwords fir my partner’s new unfinished website and database. The girl said he might use it to blackmail by deleting all the data. My partner is a sports photographer and I am an illustrator. We are in our late 50s and this has destroyed us. He is still on upwork and the girl says he gets his reviews by asking fellow freelancers for swapping reviews. Totally dishonest. I have two questions 1: Can I post his details here 2: do we have any recourse? He also has a website. Please help?

	I am being scammed and in a dispute
","Dec 15, 2019  07:22:40 AM","
Hello, I am new to Upwork. Today I talked to a freelancer and he wanted to move our chat to Whatsapp. I agreed. There he insisted on me paying him not through Upwork but I do not agree. Eventually, I made a contract on Upwork with a full deposit at $150 and 1 minute later I got an email announcing that he sent me the work but with no attachment. The next thing I see is that he deleted almost all of his messages on Whatsapp but luckily I captured a part of the chat. Too afraid, I ended the contract and now I'm in a dispute. The only evidence I got is a piece of the chat he convinced me to pay him outside because Upwork charges a high fee, a timeline of him accepting the contract and submit his ""work"" (which is nothing) in only 1 minute. I want to ask if I am likely to walk out of this dispute with my full money. I see that I did nothing wrong but I am so afraid because I don't have enough money to go to an arbitrator. I really need your help. Thank you a lot

	The work the freelancer provided was of such poor quality I couldn't accept it.
","Feb 4, 2020  10:22:17 AM","
I've encountered an issue with a job I recently posted. It was a translation assignment, but the quality of the work provided was subpar. A few days have gone by while I took my time to consider if paying this freelancer was fair or not. After all, I did not want to make a knee-jerk decision. When I posted the assignment, I went to the trouble of bothering my client to extend the deadline and increase the budget to meet the demands of the freelancer. So, you can understand how surprised I was with the lack of quality given that I did everything to accommodate the freelancer. This translation consequently had to be revised twice by different providers. Thus, incurring in further expenses. I really don't feel like I should pay for this. Please advise.

Hi,
 
Do not use Upwork, they have a fake escrow process and they allow their freelancers to extort clients for more money. The arbitration process with AAA is bogus. They tell you that you can choose from three attorneys, but that never happens. It seems that they have a hnadpicked arbitrator designed to protect their interest. The arbitrator never sought clarification and made a bogus award without consultation. It was so ridiculous that I had go back and review the message exchange with the freelancer. The arbitrator never even mnetions the $2,000 extortion amount by the freelancer.
 
All clients should run from Upwork. It took me three months to get to Arbitration and that was a waste.

	Upwork freelancer identity verification
","Oct 10, 2018  08:59:24 AM","
I would like to know, that Upwork has verified that freelancers are whom they portray they are.I know some freelancers would think it odd for a hiring company to ask that their verification be confirmed but it is quite reasonable.I ask contractors who do work on by building for insurance papers, licenses, etc because it is standard business practice. I required direct hire contractors to fill out W4 and I9 documents which the US government requires. I depend on Upwork as the vetting entity to exercise due diligence in verifying the money is going to the person I am lead to believe I have hired and am trusting with proprietary and confidential information.So my question is does Upwork verify the identity and receive W4 or I9 documents from US-based freelancers?

	Fraudulent Freelancer - *edited*
","Feb 3, 2020  05:41:19 PM","
Hello,
 
Though I have had a really good experience on UpWork so far. It is unfortunate that I recently experienced a case of fraud with a freelancer on UpWork named **edited for Community Guidelines**. I entered into an hourly contract with him to comlete data searches for me in July and August ( 2 separate contracts for a total of $142.50. Both payments were made once I approved it. We have not had any interaction since then, other than him asking me for more work and me responding that I do not have any work for him. 
 
After reviewing my invoices to reconcile payments made to all freelancers on UpWork, I found that he had fraudlently submitted work hours in December ($75), January (3X75) and February ($75). It was then that I realized that though I had No Jobs open, I had not ended his contract. Based on the escrow agreement written by UpWork, my understanding was that I had to approve all invoices. In this case, I was simply charged fraudlently. 
 
I messaged **edited for Community Guidelines** demanding that he repay me and he did not deny what he did, he says he will work for free to make up the hours. When I said no, he said he will speak to UpWork. I have reported him to UpWork and I have demanded that they remove him because no other client should have to deal with his fraudulent actions. 
 
I am waiting to see what UpWork does in this situation because the question still remains.
 
1. How were these transactions processed without my approval or release of payment
2. How does UpWork handle cases of fraud
3. How concered is UpWork with protecting its clients from fraudulent freelancers
 
I will post UpWorks response to this situation. I hope that this post will be helpful to other clients.

Hi Everyone!  I need some advice... I've been a very active client over the years ($80K+ on freelance services to date so I have a very active account).  I hired a freelancer for some data entry week way back in 2018... We did a small amount of work, and then the project was put on hold, but the contract remained active. I was doing an audit recently and went through my active contracts, and saw the contract for this person was still open.  There was no activity for almost a year, and then all of the suddent, with no communication they started maxing out the approved hours every week a few months ago - and it was for a small amount ($80) so it flew under the radar. Well this added up, and now it's $4,800 in fraudulent billings, and I'm not sure what to do?  I requested a refund for each billing as a first step.  I looked at the work diary, and they were just essentially logging in and doing nothing to max out the time... I'm in disbelief and can't believe someone would do this...your advice is very appreciated, thank you!Kind regards,Roger

	Freelancer Fraud?
","Jan 28, 2020  05:53:33 PM","
I believe a freelancer has committed fraud against us.  Being new to UpWork, I mistakenly entered a new contract in the site when I meant to send this freelancer a message. He took it as a contract, and contacted me.  In his first message he was snippy that my not responding immediately to him would hurt his rating (I was traveling).  We had one phone conversation, in which I outlined our project, and he promised to send me a proposal for services. A week later, after no contact from him, I received an email from the UpWork site saying that he charged us more than $1,000! There was no proposal, no pre-approved fees, and certainly no work submitted to us. I have cancelled the contract, but that appears to have made my ability to demand a refund from him go away.  How do I get a refund in this situation?  Thank you.

Hello everyone, Im really sad to see how bad my contract is going. I made a contract with different milestones including:-Logo-Template design-Invoice, contact card's design. We started with logo and she´s sending me a different style that we talked at the begining, she is even copying images from google and adding text with my company´s name. She is really far from what i want and even copying information. I cant recognize effort in that work. I talked to she of what i wanted after first logo´s exhibition but she's keeping doing a different style and copying from google (I didnt talked that with her at the begining cus i was really shocked). I want to finish my relations with her and i wouldnt like to pay anything as she have copied and have a different style, and she doesnt seem to understand the style im looking for. Need for help to finish the contract in a friendly manner, cannot paying that work sorry. thanks for your effort, best regards,

	Stop payment to a freelancer on hourly basis before resolving dispute.
","Jan 27, 2020  06:58:59 AM","
Good afternoon,I had my first hire on Upwork and realized that the freelance skills do not meet the job he applied for. I choose to follow upwork recommendation while setting the contract and it was done hourly.After first delivery, i realized that wahat was delivered are plain templates from the web i could have done myself, and that the freelance has no experience on what he was doing. After asking him if he has ever worked on the version of loopback 4 he confirmed that he has never worked on it but he has a 2 years experience on loopback 3, that if i choose to use it, it will be delivered much faster.I accepted and after few hours he published something, but again simple starter template, not even working and i was able to debug it and correct.Now i paused the contract but i realized that there was hours booked by the freelance and that upwork has already set it to be paid on wednesday.Now the freelance is not even answering my messages..is there a way to stop the payment until we settle and agree about the deliveries?or i should pay and ask for a refund?Thank you for your help.

	Confession - I have been an idiot client
","Jan 25, 2020  09:08:18 PM","
Most of my hires are long-term and not thru job boards. One such is my website guru who does wonderful work and keeps everything moving. I've tried to adopt her, but she wants a playground and a dog. Our yard is too small. Anyway, we have a long-standing agreement that she charges me for her work and I pay it. There's monthly maintenance work on two low-maintenance wordpresss sites, and there's the new website I asked for. I'm going to pay her for it. It needs to be thrown away. The function I need is better performed by forum software. I have written and apologized to her for wasting her time. Yes, she'll get paid for it, but she's a pro and this was wasted effort on her part. I've been hiring freelancers for twenty years, paying well, paying whatever is charged and trusting them. I've been burned a few times, but that comes with the territory. You'd think I'd know by now to discuss functionality before asking someone to do something. We're not all evil, cheating scammers, honest. Some of us are just plain stupid.

I paid $300 to a freelancer upfront on 12 Jan 2020.

The next day I opened a dispute, no one came back to me yet. They told me to wait until 5 days. I am worried If I waited too long the money which is on a 5-day mandatory hold on his account will be delivered to him. I don't know how else I urge the dispute team to take action immediately. Question is if I opened a dispute on some money, will that be on hold till the time dispute ends?Another is if they are going to take a long time for action which can risk of losing money, will it be appropriate If I ask for a chargeback from my credit card company?

Upwork, please hire a UX-designer and fix your user interface – make it user friendly and intuitive. Even basic things are flawed: For example, clicking my user name in the header (after clicking the round user icon) closes the pop-up window. Why would it not take me to my user profile?Clicking the notification icon in the pop-up window (see attachment), which tells me that I have 1 unread message, closes the pop-up window. Why would it not take me to my messages?Clicking the ""Upwork Community"" logo in the community-header does not take me to the home page of Upwork community. Why not?Not all links have a pointer-cursor, indicating a clickable link. The ""attachment"" link below the text box when writing a new topic is just one example.This is really just basic principles of interface design. And we haven't even talked about the heart of Upwork – Jobs, Freelancers and Reports. After spending one hour to find out where I can find my freelancer feedback, I realised just how bad your interface design is. Sorry to say it. But I'll have to. Because the concept and overall principles of Upwork is really great, and I'll continue to use your site and hire more freelancers.

	Fraudulent Freelancer Profiles
","Jun 4, 2018  10:46:42 AM","
I have very serious concerns about offshore freelancers creating and using flaudulent profiles that were supposedly verifiied by Upwork. The last two offshore freelancers I hired created fraudulent profiles and I am trying to understand the process Upwork uses to verify a freelancers identity.  I lost over $500 to one of those freelancers and Upwork refuses to terminate his profile. When I confronted the second freelancer, he responded by saying he was a verified freelancer already had done video call with Upwork to verify his identity. I have strong evidnece to the contray and I can prove inconclusively that both of these freelancers profiles are fraudelent. I reported by of these freelancers to Upwork and both freelancers are still active. Upwork may be unaware that unscupulus offshore freelancers have figured out how to get around the freelancer verification process. But I am struggling to understand why Upwork refuses to take action after I have reported these freelancers and provided evidence of fraud. I am left with the impression Upwork simply doesn't care because enforcing it's terms of service regarding freelancer profiles would result in lost revenues.

	**Edited** scammers
","Jan 14, 2020  10:20:00 AM","
Why does Upwork continue to allow these scammers to use the site, even when they know they are a fraud?  
Numerous times now I have hired an ""american"" or ""canadian"" that claims to have excellent writting skills, etc and its obvious when they submit their work they are NOT from this continent!  Then upwork will suspend their account and I think great - they have found out that is person has a fake profile, fake identity, is lying, etc and they have shut them down.  
 
I hired from **Edited for community guidelines**!  The name changes.  The picture changes.  And now I have a contract with a guy **Edited for community guidelines**
And Upwork allows them to do this!?!  Even after lying and scamming people??
 
Now these scammers are holding my money hostage for a week because they are disputing my refund requests.
 
Can someone explain this to me?  Upwork is faciliting a haven for these scammers.  This has happened to my SEVERAL times.  What can I do to prevent this other than leave Upwork, which I am now on the verge of doing.
 
Any assistance or advice would be appreciated.

	Freelancer claimed his System was hacked and now my entire completed shopify store is deleted
","Dec 18, 2019  08:29:05 AM","
Hi I am very upset and miffed at upwork.  1. I contracted a freelancer on the platform2. Paid and funded work. 3. Freelancer completed Milestone 1 and 2. 4. demanded a bonus as a thank you for his work plus a 5 ***** review 5. i didnt give hmim a bonus and gave him a 4 **** review, no bad words from me6. Freelancer was very upset. 15 mins after i gave him the review, he deleted my completed shopify store we both worked on. Brough his attention to it. he blocked me from communicating with instead7. Tracked him down via whats app, claimed a hacker deleted my store (a hacker that was trying to destroy his business and his other client had the same issue wit this hacker)8. Provided all the details to upwork mediation9. Freelancer is not even disputing i have received what I paid for. 10. He is only claiming he didnt delete my store (I asked for proof of hacker issue and other customer, he has not provided any proof). 11. I have paid a total of $565 to this freelancer and still dont have a product to show for it. 12. Now Upwork is asking me to pay 291 for Arbitration to sort this out... why am i shelling more money out when the Freelancer is not disputing my store was not deleted ( either by him or by his hacker) I was ask by upwork if i will let him build me a new store and i said unless he proves that he didnt delete my store ( by showing proof a hacker did) I cannot trust this freelancer with my new credentials..13. I am upset at this way I am being treated and I demand better. let Upwork ask him to prove that it is hacker that deleted my store. 14. Shopify provided my with IP address of last log in when my store was deleted. wich is the same location at Freelancer. I have asked Upwork to confirm if this is not the same IP address they have on file for him ( I still have not gotten a respinse from shopify). 15. This very painful for me right now.

	Watch out for Upworks hidden terms about Flat Fee projects
","Jan 14, 2020  12:59:33 AM","
We have used Upwork.com and other freelance sites for hundreds of jobs and the sytems can work very well. But a recent issue causes us to warn other Clients to search very diligently through Upwork terms before using them. On a recent flat-free $1,000 project, the freelancer was going very slow and not reporting as required. To be accommodating, we gave him extra time. One day, he posts that the job is done and asks for payment, along with a note saying he would not cmopete the job or remove the bugs under we paid him another $1,000. Due to the Holidays we did not see his post immediately and Upwork released payment in full without our prior approval. I must say that the ability to contact Upwork's support is deceptively and intentionally hidden on the website - we had never even had to find it before. Talking to support reveals they really have no abilty to solve prolems, which, unfortunatley, is common for online services. As you might imagine we were not willing to pay twice for the agreed upon work. Finally we were able to file a subject a dispute and refund request. So far, it looks like Upwork's only abilty to address the issue is to pay them a $971 arbitrator fee, which is split among the parties. The cost is crazy. Luckily the freelaners is in the US so we will be able to file a small-claims to get a refund. But what a waste. For 12 years, we have worked with  many distant freelance staff members, provide them consideration for extra time and add on work. We have made lots of friends around the world too. Not all work is A+ but the work has been successful and without any significant problems. .  Now with Upworks secret terms, we are getting screwed. When you can actually find and contact Upwork staff, you will find them very apologetic but not very sincere because it seems they really take no responsibilty, and have no authority to  make things right.. When freelance services started on line the saving grace was using Escrow to ensure delivery of a product and to assure freleancers they would get paid.  Now with Upworks maniuplation of terms, the escrow system no longer protects clients. The learning lesson - watch Upwork very very carefully.

	Developer did work, got paid but wrote code to spoof google bot
","Jan 12, 2020  08:30:41 AM","
Recently, I have had an upWork developer work on my website to do some web site optimization. There was a before/after check using google pagespeed and gtmetrix. Everything went well & the speed numbers looked good. I have a different developer looking at the site and he found that there was code that 'spoofed' or affected the results of services such as GTmetrix & Google PageSpeed. For example, for Google PageSpeed bots, all loadable styles and scripts were disabled, in other words, this service is given a primitive text page, and for normal users, it's normal. I paid the first developer around $300 for the hack job.

	Ave Hourly Rate Paid ??
","Jan 12, 2020  08:58:48 AM","
I've been a Upwork client for many years ... (9?) - and on the predecessors (elance and odesk) .. I haven't checked until today the ""about the client"" panel that freelancers see - with my total feedback rating etc.For all this time - 95% of my jobs/contracts are fixed rate/milestones - coding. Only a few in the beginning were lower paying minor research or data entry jobs. But the upwork client page says:$8.51/hr avg hourly rate paid /  762 hours????Absolutely wrong!!   I probably contracted under 50 hours of hourly work (and if memory serves - probably $10/hr average) Here's my issue:  aside from being terribly inaccurate - it sends the wrong message to developers looking at my job postings (all of which are fixed budget/ milestones).... What's going on here?what am i missing?How can i correct this?

	Children's book illustrations and covers... a hiring guide.
","Jan 10, 2020  10:36:55 AM","
Hello Upwork clients!As an illustrator I see a great amount of requests for proposals on creating children's book art... and honestly, 99% of them are seriously lacking in basic details.  Without these you will likely be passed on by the more professional freelancers, and those few who do reply to your proposal will likely offer inappropriate rates for the job.  Further, you will wind up wasting a lot of time rejecting work and clarifying what you wanted to begin with... leaving you unhappy and your project unfulfilled.Think of the hiring process on Upwork as going to a restaurant that offers every dish on earth, and when the server asks what you would like, you simply say ""food.""  Obviously, it would save everyone a lot of headaches if you mention things like allergies, diet restrictions, portion sizes, preferred cooking styles, preferred ingredients, being a vegetarian, price ranges, and so on.So here is a list of things you should consider ahead of time, and ideally include in your request for proposal...1. The basics...How many pages? Do you need a cover? Size of the pages?(If you are self publishing, all of that has to be known in order for you to get a cover that fits correctly.  You even have to know what kind of paper you will print on.) 2. The style...What age group are you writing for? What sort of media... ink, pencil, waterclor, crayon, digital paint, etc?  What sort of look.... Disney, ""Caillou"", comic book, anime, realistic, etc? (The reader's age will determine what style, colors, font size, and word choice is appropriate. Provide samples or a list of books you like... this will help you weed out freelancers who can't work in a certain style and attract those that can.)3. Characters...How many are there? Are they humans, animals, creatures, fish, etc?(The more characters you have, the more unique looks have to be created AND the more crowded a drawing will be... which is obviously more difficult for your artist.  This is especially true for books targeting infants/toddlers... they might differenciate characters by respective sizes and shirt colors, while older readers are able to notice more subtle details. Further, some artists may be experts at drawing people but terrible with animals.)4. Format...Horizontal or vertical format?  Do you want art and text on the same page? Do you want borders around art? Do you want text overlayed onto the art? Will there be art on every page, or only highlighting important parts of the story?(Simple bordered or separate page art you can insert into a document yourself, but if you want art and text combined, you will need a second freelancer with experience in book formatting, or better yet, an artist that can do it to begin with. Font style should match the art and the tone of the writing.  The amount of text on each page should be balanced and leave room for artwork.  The space allocated for artwork will determine how detailed/intricate the art can be as well as how scenes are laid out... the use of white space, visual focus and so on...)5. Project milestones...I highly recommend you provide your freelancer the text at the beginning, and assuming you hammered out all the details listed above, the first milestone should be 'schematic design'.... get the entire book laid out in quick-sketch, storyboard form.  The location of text and art should be roughly planned for every page.  This will help you avoid pages with too much/too little text and ensure what is written is 'worthy' of accompanying art (i.e. the page's text isn't just transitional/fluff... there is a plot point to be highlighted by art). This should be a short, fast process and be about 10% of the project cost.The second milestone should be 'design development'... basically the revised version of the first milestone... updated text, text placement, and art layout.  You should have already conveyed who your printer will be and what their requirements are regarding print areas, bleed, bar code placement and so on to your freelancer so they know how much space they have to work in.  This should take twice as long as step one, and cost about 20% of the project.The third milestone should be 'design production'... where final art is created and married with the text. This should be the bulk of the project's schedule and worth 60% of it's cost.  You can break this down into further milestones if you want to monitor progress more closely...  but again, if you went through the early steps of conveying exactly what you want from the start, there shouldn't be too much hand-holding required.The fourth milestone should be 'final design'... basically the last looks and tweaks of what should be a ""95%"" complete job... there should be little work involved besides getting your final approval of the inside pages and possibly adjusting any cover design.  Remember, the cover art's width (for full cover art) is determined by the company printing/binding you book- the spine thickness depends on number of pages and paper thickness you chose. Once you have your final product, you can release that last 10% of funding.I hope this guide helps you and your prospective freelancer(s) realize your project with ease and efficiency.  Happy writing!Louis Eliopoulos

	Frustration with no communication after waiting a week for work
","Feb 16, 2017  03:05:49 PM","
Hi all Firstly, I'd like to say that I'm a huge fan of Upwork and have used it successfully in the past. I hired a freelancer for a job with a time-sensitive deadline, and after the deadline passed I didn't hear from her. I waited 24 hours until I went through to cancel the contract and request for the funds to be returned. I put trust in the freelancer to do this work - and she did not. And now it seems that I cannot post negative feedback to warn other employers that she has done this. In fact, it says on my screenshot that the contract was ""completed"" - um, it was certainly not completed!! Am I missing something? How do we protect ourselves from hiring people who don't deliver, if we cannot leave feedback to state what has happened? Indeed - I did see the ""78% job success"" rate on her profile (after I'd hired her) - and now I guess I know what that means!! Any help/tips/advice would be appreciated.ThanksAmy

	Freelancer acting toxic and threatening to leak content from a project after being fired
","Sep 6, 2019  07:16:34 AM","
I hired a freelancer who completed 2 milestones of a project, then demanded I double the budget or walk away. Since the amount he requested was more that double actually (requesting $500 on a $200 milestone, not exact numbers but I rounded to the nearest hundred for you guys), and since I was having problems with the freelancer's attitude (he became defensive when I asked him to correct a small mistake), I fired him. I figured there was no chance of us working together because of these conflicts. After firing him, he stated I could not use any of the submitted work as he planned to use it. When I reminded him it was the other way around - I paid for the work and owned the rights, and thus he was the one who was not entitled to do so - he became quite hostile, lying in his review (which doesn't matter to me too much), and angrily berating me to the point I had to block him. I am concerned that the freelancer will continue his aggressive behavior by leaking content, stealing the project, and potentially harassing me outside of the site. What should I do?

I am starting to use upwork for a very small project(s), say <$200 each.I have a larger project that I would like to attempt (probably in the $5k-10k range, I've never attempted something like this before). I know what platform I would use (WordPress, out-of-the-box plugins, etc), but nothing beyond that - only what I want the site to contain in the end. The site involves pulling data from other sites/APIs and creating a database that would then display on this site. I am not a programmer/techie of any kind. I am wondering what advice people have on how to begin. I have a lengthy description of specifics that I am looking for, but have no idea how a freelancer would complete it: the time required, what cost, what technology would be used. In a case like this would I ask a few people for proposals (and of course pay for each person's time to create a proposal)?

I'm sticking to my guns and I'm going to make him go through with the project whether he likes it or not, since he's the one who sent that proposal at that price (which is a reasonable one, too). I'd like to know, what's the general protocol for this situation?

	I think the upwork mediation process on released milestone funding is flawed
","Mar 20, 2017  12:15:31 PM","
I engaged **Edited for Community Guidelines** to develop an app. It was agreed on a fixed price contract. They spread out the milestones to cover all of the payment. Each milestone in isolation does not mean anything. I released funding for the milestone up until total payment of $2200. The freelancer **Edited for Community Guidelines** stopped responding to my communication. I asked upwork to mediate and they came back to say nothing they could do to help get the funds back as i authorised the payments to the freelancer. I think the refund policy or mediation on fixed price jobs be reviewed. It was clearly obvious the freelancer couldn't deliver on the project and they capitalised on a weak point in the mediation process. The release of a milestone does not necessarily mean the job is complete. It can mean payment to the freelancer to proceed to the next stage.

	Milestone Creation - 4 or 5 extra steps now?
","Dec 16, 2019  06:59:46 AM","
In the past, after I released payment for a milestone, a new tab opened where I could type in the next milestone and hit submit. 1-step Something changed. Now I make a payment and I'm taken to the contract screen. I click ""Add milestone"" and the only thing I can do is add a title and an amount. Then I click save. Then it takes me back to another screen. Then I click Activate. Then I type in a description of the milestone and click activate.  Is there a way to do this in 1 step anymore, or have we just bloated the process for everyone to benefit a couple of people?

	Cannot Add Billing Method

	Account suspended - account name
","Dec 22, 2019  04:25:22 AM","
Hi!A few days ago I decide to change ""my company"" name and suddenly my account was suspended. If I would have not changed anything my account would have been working well as usual. It has been days since this happened and all I got was a very slow answer and now that I replied I will probably get yet another slow answer. I am paying from my pocket, what sense does it make to demand a company name! Which company? And if this is an issue, why not reverting to my old setup and allow me to recruit freelancers again? My goal is to recruit freelancers and since upwork isn't actually understanding the urgency and trying to solve this, anyone has another solution to solve this so that I can recruit freelancers still today? Thank you!Vasco

	Work started before acceptance of offer, freelancer did not finish project
","Dec 23, 2019  09:29:12 AM","
Hello, needing some advice here. My company has used Upwork quite a few times in the past with great success. Recently, I submitted an offer to a freelancer who started working on the project but never accepted the offer. I asked him to accept it so others would stop submitting proposals but he did not. After assuring me several times the project was going well, he missed the final deadline and left me in a extremely difficult spot with one of our largest clients. How did this happen? Was it because he never accepted the offer so there is no accountablility for doing the project as he said he would - on time? Just need to understand for the future should we use Upwork again. Thank you.

Hello,Clearly I am new to Upwork. How do you include the hourly rate you are offering in a job post? I currently have a long term, hourly position job post created. While editing the listing, in the ""Budget"" section there is no field to enter an hourly rate, and I cannot for the life of me find anywhere else to input the information. I have seen a plethora of job posts that include offered rates, so it is clearly common. The position is entry-level, and I do not want to waste anyone's time, including my own, with applicants that are not interested in the rates we can offer.

	Freelancer is blackmailing me
","Mar 25, 2019  02:25:07 AM","
Hi Everyone, A freelancer finished the first version of my site mid last year (hourly rate contract), and when I said I would get a code review, they freaked out and admitted that the backend had ""bad structure"" and would not pass a code review. So they offered to rebuild the site for free.  The new version has been code reviewed by 3 coders, and each said that there was a third party folder that contains the freelancer's in-house code that they must use as a base to start each new project, and that the freelancer should integrate that folder's code into my main code base. Otherwise the code is not complete and I am tied to them until I have it all. The freelancer claims it's safety thing, so that code reviewers can't steal the code. But since I am the owner of the code, surely it's up to me to arrange contracts with the reviewing parties. Which I did. So now they are saying that they will not hand over the complete code until I agree to their terms for a new contract and start paying them again. They are saying that I own the first version of the site, but not the new version, claiming that the new version was done outside of Upwork. But it wasn't. We simply paused payments while they rebuilt the site (Sept 2017 - March 10, 2019). And they only recently closed the contract, without discussing it first, on March 10. So the contract was active throughout the rebuild, but there was no time or payments logged. They admitted the first site was substandard, offered to rebuild without payment, but won't hand over the code until I start a new contract with them. 1/ Given what I explained, who actually owns the code? 2/ Is this blackmaill?3/ How can I get the code for my site?  Upwork are calling me tomorrow morning. But I'd appreciate any wisdom you could share with regard to this situation so I can sleep better tonight!  Thanks in advance. Zane

I am new to upwork and had hired a guy to improve my app and fix one important function on my app as well as some other things so it could get approved on ios as it is already approved on android.  Now the guy is acting really shady and i don't want to lose my money.  He doesnt seem to want to listen and is just doing pretty much what he wants without actually doing what I really need.  He agreed to fix the problem in the beginning but now is acting like we didnt even talk about it.  
 
We had a fixed price of $300 and made two milestone kickoff and finished product, I already released kickoff, would it be possible to get all my money back if we have problems in the end?  Was this the wrong way to do it?  
 
You can see in the first pic of chat he agrees to everything and now is acting like we never discussed any of this.  I had talked to him thru phone call about everything.  He just on his own decided to re create whole app for no reason really and didnt even fix the problem.  I just dont want to lose my money.

	How do I extend the due date for a milestone?
","Feb 18, 2019  10:22:24 PM","
My freelancer had been occupied with other job and did not had enough time to complete the (fixed-price) work within the target due date for a funded milestone. I do not have any problems with it, however to release the funds I would like to extend his due date to future, once the job is completed. Can anyone suggest best possible approach here? My last resort would be to cancel the job and create a new one for him. I just wanted to avoid doing that and result in confusion.

	Help with a refund
","May 26, 2016  10:40:33 AM","
Hi Upwork community, I hope you are all having a great day! I was wondering if some of you could give me some insight on my situation. I hired a developer from India to build me a MVP for a simple app. Although I kept asking him for an estimate (asked around 14 times) he could never give me one. The hours kept clocking, and 8 weeks and $2700+ later, he gave me an estimate of another 8 weeks at 500$ a week. The 2 builds he sent me did not work. The designs were ok but needed to be modified to make them more user friendly, something which I kept instructing him to do with no fruition. Every week, it was the same problems with the build and nothing was changed. I paused the contract and had the code reviewed by a friend who told me that it was useless and the database for the app was a catastrophe. I disputed the work done because I felt truly unhappy. The freelancer refused to give me a feedback, even when I offered partial payment to end things in good faith. He said he worked hard, yet at the end turned around and said that he couldn't give a refund because the developers had been paid, so he subcontracted without my knowledge. Is this allowed?  I have never had a problem with any other freelancers, still have amazing working relationships with ones I hired. In the end I found someone really great here in the US to build me the app, but from the freelancer in India I have no build, no designs and no refund. So I basically threw $2700+ down the drain and Upwork didn't do anything about it.  Has anyone else come across such a situation and how did you resolve it? Thank you all in advance!

	Invoice of the Payment processing fee

I am a registered business in the EU, and I already entered my EU VAT number into my Upwork account.I have a question regarding the 2.75% payment processing fee Upwork will charge me as a client.I read somewhere that the Upwork company has an EU VAT starting with ""EU"", since it is a US company which registered in the EU for VAT purposes. But I don't see the Upwork's EU VAT number on the invoices/receipts at all, is it by designs? If you have the EU VAT number, why don't you display it on the invoices? Second question, I think I should receive a separate invoice (and not a receipt) which includes only the 2.75% charge as the invoice amount, and nothing else. Third question, isn't this payment processing fee a service I am buying from a US company as an EU company? If so, then the term ""VAT reverse charged"" should appear next to the payment processing fee, or not? I see the term ""VAT reverse charged"" only on the final invoice which was issued by the freelancer, but it is without the payment processing fee.But the payment processing fee is not subject to ""VAT reverse charged""?

","Dec 2, 2019  03:06:47 AM","
The freelancer spent ~1 minute creating a blank Google doc, and I got charged 10 minutes for it. Is this normal behavior here on Upwork when the pay is by the hour?! My freelancer has completed a little over a dozen projects and have over $20,000 earned; however, she doesn't know how the work diary functions (or maybe she does!). 8:10, 8:20, 8:30, 8:40, 8:50, 9:00, 9:10, 9:20, etc. From what I can understand, ANY work done between these time ranges are automatically put into their respected 10-minutes time slots. No matter how small the time spent working on the freelancer's side, the client is still being charged for the full 10-minutes? If I'm wrong, then my freelancer started at 6:30 and just waited until 6:39 to create a blank Google doc.
 
I am planning on spending one grand for the freelancer to work on my resume and LinkedIn profile, but I feel like the freelancer is slacking. Her rate is $80 per hour, and she also charges me for answering her questions while she stays idle. After I finished answering her questions, there was no response from her. 5 hours and 20 minutes later, she used the Upwork Desktop App to capture our old chat messages for one whole hour. We weren't even chatting at that point.
 
What sort of options do I have here? I am comtemplating terminating the contract and going on another freelancer platform to hire a resume/Linked profile writer.

	Our Freelancer's Account was Wrongly Blocked
","Nov 26, 2019  05:11:44 PM","
Hi, my company's freelancer, **edited for Community Guidelines**, just informed us that his account was suspended under false alleged pretexts and that customer support was unable to help him. We would like to continue working with him on upwork. If we fail to have this issue resolved, we will have no choice but to start paying him outside of upwork. Again, this is not our desire, and wish to see his account restored. He has been a pleasure to work with and has done brilliant work for us.

	not user friendly for clients
","Nov 28, 2019  08:01:11 PM","
Hello dear community, hope you're doing well. I don't usually come here but sometimes I feel it's necessary; as a client in my first hiring someone, after hiring I noticed the job with the applicants disappeared completely. I can't see nothing, so what if someday later I need to hire another freelancer from there right away? I think after hiring it'd be left there in the jobs list intact. I was thinking maybe Upwork can hire me to help them mo make the platform more user friendly.

	[Suggestion] Mark inactive saved freelancers
","Nov 28, 2019  09:16:40 AM","
When a freelancer who is in My List becomes inactive so Upwork is not listing them in search, it would be nice to put a marker in My List letting the client know. Alternatively, you could add Last connected: [date] on their profile. The reason I'm asking is because I've already invited two from my saved list who never responded to the invites. Since both are newbies without any work history, but with a skill not easy to come by, I can imagine that they got bored of Upwork and abandoned their profiles. Hanging and waiting for them to show a proof of life is frustrating and a waste of time.

	Credit card transactions vs invoice totals
","Nov 27, 2019  10:50:54 AM","
I am trying to do my credit card expense report for work. I went to download the appropriate invoices so that I could turn them in with my report. However, the invoice totals don't always match the transaction totals made on my credit card. For example, I have a credit card transaction for 154.50. I am assuming that this charge includes the processing fee. However, I don't have an invoice with this amount. I that there is one for the $150. I have another transaction for $772.50 but no invoice that matchs the transaction total. There is one for the $750 I contracted the job for. How can I get an invoice that reflects the total amount of each transaction?P.S. I think Upwork is a brilliant website! You also seem to have the best of the best for recruitment. I have been extremely pleased with the results. However, your lack of customer support to those that are not ""paid"" members is absolutely infuriating! Thanks,Lisa

Hi Upwork,
 
I am a first time user to UpWork and created a new account yesterday.  I had just finished drafting a job post and paid $29.99 for the premium service and immediately after I paid, your system permanently deactivated my account and took my money.
 
From your email:
**Edited for community guidelines**
 
**Edited for community guidelines**, where you deactivate accounts immediately after users pay, take their money, and state that you will not reply if that user tries to contact you.  I had to make a new account to make this post so that other users are aware to stay away from this platform.  If this is a mistake, please reopen my account and/or refund my money.

Does anyone else wish Upwork invoices included the Activity ID line item? This seems like a simple addition to make, which would be greatly beneficial to companies that employ freelancers who budget time to different Activity IDs depending on the project/department requesting the work.Adding this little bit of information to their invoicing would save clients a huge amount of time reconciling the billed amounts to various projects and departments.

For the purpose of the question, let's say he completed 50% of the job. I will be posting the job again, but this time I have source code, so the next developer won't have to start from scratch.  How can I factor in this existing code into the budget when creating the post? For example, my budget is $1,500 if the job's done from scratch. Do I specify $1,500 in my project even though it know that a percentage is already complete? Thanks.

	FILING A COMPLAINT
","Nov 18, 2019  08:29:15 PM","
In September I hired a contractor to build an app. The work was steadily going along. The contractor and I agreed on a fixed price that was calculated by the number of hours it would take to build the app. At 66 hours we hit a roadblock. I was told that the workspace for the app would be delivered, and it was. . However it was missing a critical component. The contractor said I was 34 hours behind in payment, two weeks ago. I paid for the hours to bring the contract current. The workspace functions I needed were created a week ago. then I asked to have then clean up redundant items on the workspace. During that time I created an additional milestone and I was ready to create another milestone today. But the issues still have not been addressed. tthat is thhe two most critical functions. this happened on Friday. They sent me a link to the admin panel with little or no instructions. 12 hours have gone by and I still don't have an answer. I don't mind paying for the app weekly, but I don't want to pay for something before I can at least test what I have during the process. Not sure how to proceed.

	Freelancer Opening a Dispute When I tried to Cancel
","Nov 3, 2019  12:47:22 PM","
Hi There!
 
I am definitely not new to Upwork, and I have hired a lot from this site, though this is the first time anything like this has happened to me. 
 
I hired a freelancer for a 500-word article that I was paying $5.00 for. This was a fixed-price. The freelancer claimed on their profile that they were a native English speaker based in Canada. I sent directions for the 500-word article. He sent back one of the most poorly written articles I have ever seen, which was over 900-words filled with grammar issues, broken English, etc. 
 
I sent it back for edits, and I told him that it was very poorly written and the language was very strange (i.e. obvioulsy broken English). He said he would do the edits, but then he sent back an article that was not fixed with everything I asked for...which was to follow the directions, which he didn't, fix up his grammar, which he didn't, and to make it sound better...it didn't. So, I sent him this -- The writing isn't good enough for this project. On top of not having great grammar, I was also looking to see if you could follow directions. I asked for a 500 word article in Calibri 12 font with no future tense, like the word ""will."" This was over 900 words, you used Calibri 11, and there are two instances of ""will."" (In quotes, which still isn't good for this client.)So, I think at this point it's best to simply cancel the contract.
 
He did not respond....instead, 10 hours later I get a totally different article, and a message from the freelancer that says this ---**edited for Community Guidelines**
 
I cancelled the contract at this point, as the new article was just as terrible as the other two. Soon after, I got a notification that the freelancer opened a dispute. 
 
He is obviously not a native English speaker, he has misrepresented himself on his profile, he gave me an article that looks like a middle school student wrote who has English as a second language, and he wants me to pay for this?? 
 
As a client, am I seriously expected to pay for an article that is terribly written? I would even attach it, here, but I don't want to shame the guy...I just don't want to pay for a rubbish article that I will never, ever use because it's so badly written.

	New Freelancer
","Nov 17, 2019  09:04:33 AM","
I hired a freelancer to do some wordpress changes to my site.I chose someone who was new to upwork and had a lower rate - thinking that I could help the freelancer get started.  The examples of work she made clear were sites that she had worked on, but not created herself.She spent a very lime trying to access my site and gave me her email address so that I could send the password to her directly, which I did not do.Late last week she did some work, but did not follow instructions and spent a long time doing something that should have taken an hour or two. The bill went to $125 and she then went on working, after asking me to extend her hours, which I did not.I paused the job.  I had a similar experience 2 years ago in which freelancer did some electronic circuitry but then never finished it and then filed for $300 and paid beyond what was agreed on.I contact Upwork and they immediately suspend the freelancer who was in a gang in German who was doing this to others.  I was refunded and he was banned, but they said to be careful as these people will sign up under new names and start all over again.I have contacted the freelancer 4 times asking that she agree to reduce the charge before I complain to Upwork.  She refuses to respond and instead, if she responds at all tells me to increase the number of billing hours for the overtime work she is doing.What is my next step, please?  Suggestions, please.  I have had quite a bit of work done by freelancers and value their work, but this one is a new one on me.

	No or few proposals to new jobs
","Nov 17, 2019  05:48:19 AM","
It seems that lately, I have unusually few proposals. I don't know if this is an algorithmic issue with the system, bad luck in my posting strategy, or what.  Here's an example post:https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01a2b3d8ffbfa95a58I'd expect there to be a bunch of hits for a simple post like this one, but 0 applications in the past 16 hours?

	Cost Estimate
","Nov 16, 2019  10:23:10 AM","
When posting a job, you ask the person posting to provide an estimate for the job. I understand that, however, you need another line that asks the freelancer to provide an estimate for the job if the poster has no idea what a job will cost. I lost a potential bidder for my work because she thought I had set the price way too low, which I did more as a placeholder than a real estimate. Thanks

	VAT Europe for Companies (Clients)
","Nov 13, 2019  03:20:00 AM","
Hello,here is the problem. There is a company based in Europe. The company buys a service from a freelancer based in Europe, but in a different country. The invoice between the freelancer and the company does not show the VAT number of the freelancer. Therefore, VAT reverse change mechanism can't be applied. Therefore, the company MUST pay VAT in his country  and it will NEVER get it reimbursed.  Easy (but technically wrong) solution: the company accounts for the receipt of Upwork as invoice instead than the one of the freelancer. Upwork is considered the service provider and VAT reverse charge apply (since Upwork is based outside Europe).  Is there another viable solution (techincally correct)?

	Freelancer suddenly not online!
","Nov 16, 2019  03:58:03 AM","
I've been working with a freelancer since January and everything has been going along well. Suddenly, 2 days ago I sent a project and I haven't heard anything from my freelancer. I don't know if something has happened to him or what. This has never occurred before - the longest I went without hearing from him was about 6 hours one time. It's now been 36 hours and I am in a total panic that I have to start all over again with someone new. I have done over 70 milestones with this one freelancer since January.  Has anyone ever had this happen? I don't know what else to do - I have sent several messages asking if everything is ok. Nothing. Haven't seen the orange or green indicator that he has been online either when I check, but it appears he has some other jobs in process also.  Panicking here!!!

	Upwork removed message dialog to invite freelancers to a job with a personalized note
","Oct 31, 2019  05:41:23 PM","
Upwork has removed the option to write a personal note in a job invitation when you click ""Invite to Job"" from the ""post a job"" or ""saved freelancers"" areas. Now, when you click ""Invite to Job,"" it just sends the standard note and tells you they have been invited. Not sure how recently this happened. This of course cripples our ability to connect with freelancers in a thoughtful way, and makes every job invite look like spam. Support explained this decision to me as a means to accelerate the invitation process. I'm sure that it does result in x% faster throughput, but it caused me to waste two invitations to top freelancers who will likely never answer me, plus 20 minutes with Support. Happily, I found this... WORKAROUND: save the freelancer's profile link elsewhere and open it in a new window. From the freelancer's profile page, the ""Invite to Job"" button behaves as it used to, opening a message window that allows you to write your own note explaining why you selected this person, and what next steps to plan for.

	""About The Client"" in Job Postings Should Show Combined Stats for All Linked Client Profiles
","Nov 12, 2019  10:20:43 PM","
As you know, a client can create multiple ""client accounts"" linked to a single Upwork login. We use this because we have a few different customers that we hire on behalf of because it allows us to keep things more organized and use different billing information per ""client account"". It's clear that these accounts are all managed by us since they're linked, but when we post a job, it uses only the stats of that client account, which hurts our hiring capabilities. For example, we have one client account with years of history and many hirings, and another with only one hiring over a couple of years. When we post a job we expect to show our hiring percentage and rating from all of our ""client accounts"" but it separates it as if a ""client account"" is separate in every way. Upwork - can you change this or give us the option to enable combine stats?

	** Upwork Agency framed me for extortion to remove reviews from Clutch.co, and more
","Nov 8, 2019  07:19:31 AM","
I hired an **Edited for Community Guidelines** company on Upwork for the development of my SaaS. The sales person was very good, and we agreed upon the software specification, budget, and milestones - with an estimation of 56 days.
 
After the intial payment, everything started to go wrong:
 
1) The previous milestones haven't been completed as to the specification outlined in SRS. 2) The QA as promised was non existent 3) Constantly delivered tasks that were not complete 4) Didn't use at PM tool as stated in our contract until a few weeks into development after I stated 5) My assigned PM didn't update project milestones in PM tool after initial creation 6) Asking for payment stating incomplete milestone is complete - when it's not, and full of bugs. Upon further questions they just wanted me to release payment to see if they could reach their monthly financial goal.
7) They were purposly leaving the developent of most of the system to the final milestone, which was not agreed to in our contract.
 
The project failed,  I ended the upwork contract - they were requesting me to release payment for the current milestone they claim to have worked on, namely not built to specification,  just like the previous milestones. 
 
They cost me over 6 months of my time, $4,060.00, with nothing to show - I don't even have any source code from the previous milestones, let alone the latest.
 
I left them negative reviews accross Upwork, Clutch.Co, Google listing, and Goodfirms - all have been removed.
 
They reported my Clutch review to their moderation team, providing them with fake screenshots of Skype conversations, framing me for extortion, namely threating to leave negative reviews in return for a fee. They used my profile picture from LinkedIn too.
 
Clutch immeditely removed my review, taking  fake skype screenshots as gospal, without even consulting me, let alone accepting evidence from my side. 
 
I have no doubt, the scammers will also frame me on Upwork if they don't use Upworks remove one review every 3 months tool. 
 
And therein more clients who put their trust in Upwork, and all the review sites fall vicitim.
All my communication with the scammers has been through Upwork messenger, so maybe Upwork will be able to see the truth (if they care).

--- So I did not think anything went wrong or in a bad way. But then I send another job offer to her and she refused to work with me again. When she refused I told her I was confused, and that I thought everything went very well. Here are her own words:
 
**Edited for Community Guidelines**
 
In my opinion, this is a very unprofessional approach. We were happy with her work, and took the effort to explain and share all information needed to create the documents. Now I will have to explain to another freelancer, wasting time... and only because I left a 4.85 star review instead of 5. I responded to with the following to the freelancer:
 
**Edited for Community Guidelines**
 
So at the end of the day, the choice is made and I will move on. I only post this to create a dialogue about this experience and maybe some of you think I am wrong? Do I need to change my approach and just leave 5 stars even if I think it was slightly less than a 5 star experience? Give me your thoughts. Every experience is an opporunity for growth.

Hi support team, When I created my account for the first time to hire a freelancer, I didn't realise I would automatically get invoices (without the need to manually type my info). So, I used my nickname, not the company's name...and when I received invoices, I realised they were not correct. I updated my profile info but I have no idea how to amend my previous invoices (I have paid and finalised them already...) Please let me know if they can be reissued, I really need them to be correct. Thanks!

	How to file a complaint against unresponsive freelancer that has not done work or followed contract
","Nov 4, 2019  06:24:35 AM","
Good morning,
 
My name is Jonathan MacMillan, and I hired a Google server architect (**Edited for Community Guidelines** on Upwork; goes by **Edited for Community Guidelines**) to code Google Docs, Slides, Classroom and Meet video integration into my mobile app. I have paid the freelancer in over 3 milestones already, in which he has shown me through Upwork video calls progress of the Google Docs integration. However, none of this shows in the Bitbucket code repository, and the freelancer has not been able to provide a demo APK for the app in full working condition for over a year, despite messages saying many of these sections of code are complete. I was hoping that Upwork would have a rather seemless complaint and refund process, however I have been having the most difficult time locating these. What should be done is a section above the freelancer messages that allows the client to file complaints or incident reports. I would like my case investigated (I have the full Bitbucket Repository to show that no progressive work other than beginning the Google Classroom API).

Hello everyone, I'm having a bit of a problem here, I hired a freelancer for a software job but in the middle of the contract upwork suspended his account, sent me an email that he has history of not completing jobs and refunded my initial payment. He was already almost done with my job, he requested to deal else where but I insisted that we do it here, so he made another account and verified it and got the job done and paid fully on his new account. Upwork again suspended his new account (don't know why) and again refunded the money. And of course now he wants to get paid outside. I can pay him no problem but don't want this to affect my Upwork profile especially that I also have a freelancer account alongside my client account, and I would like to know how can I withdraw the refunded money as the refund was issued to my account not to my visa. Or maybe can I transfer those to my freelancer account for later use. I issued a support ticket yesterday with no response.. Thank You,

	Upwork Talent Specialist Gone Wrong -- STOP CHEATING YOUR CUSTOMERS!
","Oct 31, 2019  04:31:28 AM","
Dear Upwork community,  I have generally had good experience with paying an expensive premium fee for my job post and hired talent specialists to help me filter good candidates. However, this good experience came to an end a few months ago. And as a matter of fact, the current service couldn't be worse in my opinion.  In the past, the talent specialists would send me a shortlist of good quality candidate within 20 minutes of my job post, and would discuss with me regarding my needs, check in with me frequently if the candidates that he/she found would meet my needs, or if he/she needed to help me look for more. This, however, was not the case since couple of months ago.  Whenever I post a job now, the talent specialist that I got assigned to would never be online and would never be responsive, nor would he look for any candidates for me. What we had to do was to contact the customer service department, but would be told that this is handled by the talent specialist department and that they would get back to me in 24 hours. And indeed, 24 hours later, I would get their response -- basically saying --""I am busy, serving a lot of clients. I tried to search, but nobody on upwork fits your requirement"", which is completely bull**bleep**ting. If you want to ask any follow up questions, that would be another marathon run. You would have to contact the customer support again, explaining the whole issue, because the talent specialist would not answer your follow-up questions. And this will just become an endless cycle, wasting clients ++++++ time.  This is not an individual case. It happened again and again.  Customer service department is completely useless, since they cannot handle the issue. And specialist department is never reachable from customer' side, which makes the problem 10 times more frustrating.  If Upwork still cares about your integrity and your business reputation, you should STOP CHEATING YOUR CUSTOMERS FROM NOW ON!

	Not paying fixed-rate contract - Particular Case
","Oct 26, 2019  05:01:41 AM","
Hello,I am engaging with a difficult freelancer. A couple of weeks ago we started a project that should have been delivered in around 10 days.After starting, the freelancer went unresponsive and not giving me updates.When I asked for update he was elusive, so after 3-4 days like this I messaged to him that he was not a professional and that I was very disappointed.He instantly answered to me, while showing me a simple image of its work, and ended the contract saying that he has some difficulties to respect the deadlines. Then I knew that he has completed 10% of the work when he should have completed at least 60% at that time. At that point, as I didn't want to also have wasted my time, I said to him that we could create another contract and that he must give me constant updates or let me know if there are some issues.Several times he was unresponsive or he said that he would have delivered part of the work at a specific time, but actually he showed up later or whenever he wanted. Really frustrating. Then he told me that he has big family problems. I have been empathetic but now we are at the third contract with a formal today deadline and he told me that he would have delivered the work yesterday. Of course no work has been delivered, he didn't write me anything so far. Apart from the quality of the work that was not so satisfying, I am very angry that I have to pay someone with so little professionalism. Personal problems should be handled better, as I could have hired someone else. Is there a way that I could end the contract without paying him or is it impossible? He hasn't formally delivered anything through the ""Send the work and require payment"" button. Looking forward to your answers. Thanks in advance.

Please enter a new billing method and try again."", despite the fact that 1 minute before everything was good. Also, I tried to create a new paypal account with only one card that I want as main source of fund.

	Can I cancel a contract and reverse an escrow if unhappy?
","Oct 24, 2019  08:28:55 PM","
Hi There, I've been using Upwork for several years and never thought to do this until now, I hired someone for a design job. I made several requests including specific colors to use and gave examples of what I liked. The results after waiting a week are quite simple, plain and not even following the design structure I outlined or color scheme. He stated several times that he understood and I asked multiple times if he could do a basic mockup to ensure we were on the right track which didn't happen. I'm already worried that this designer is not going to understand what I'm trying to do and I really need to move forward and get this done with a designer who understands what I'm trying to do and can achieve it. These initial results are just not it at all and if he has simply showed me something earlier on I could have corrected him but his work style is one that I'm concerned will waste my time and money if I allow it to go any further. My question is can I cancel a contract for these reasons? It's about $600 for the design contract between the logo, label and styleguide. I've hired people on fiverr that did better work for $25 if I'm honest. Can I pay a partial amount and end it for his time? Any suggestions are welcome!

	1st Payment Verification - Amount 1 & Amount 2
","Oct 25, 2019  10:02:18 AM","
Hi,
 
Just join to this community.
I have a question. When you add card details, they will withdraw twice two random amount. Correct?
 
Then you need to tell them the amount. that money will be returned back. Correct?
 
My concern is: **Edited for community guidelines**
 
Now a friend of mine has the same problem. Because is an exchange rate there, the money will come back less and you lose money there. Because of the exchange rate will be different.
 
Do you think is fair play? Is not a lot of money but I dispute if not come back same amount.
 
UpWork didn't write to much about this, or at least ""live support"" = Zero. Only if write on customers support or community support.
 
Now we see. I want to ask if everyone has the same problem, and what do you think about this?
 
Best regards.

	Project funds being deducted multiple times when offers withdrawn or declined.
","Oct 24, 2019  03:07:08 PM","
Does UpWork have any plans to change their Escrow deposit method? It's a major inconvenience when a job is offered to a freelancer but the circumstances change and they decline or you have to withdraw the offer and the project fee has already been deducted from your account. To hire someone else the money is deducted again and the initial fee is withheld for a further 5 days! This is an issue for small businesses and a major turnoff for using this platform.  Why not set up a system where the project fee is held for the actual job and released when the job is completed, by whichever freelancer that ends up being? As a client trying to do the right thing an honour payments upfront we shouldn't be penalised if the freelancer doesn't accept the offer or if circumstances change. Please change this ASAP!

	I'm astonished with this platform unpleasant response to opening a client's account.
","Oct 24, 2019  01:52:01 AM","
I’m so stressed with this platform’s response to opening a client account in order to hire freelancers. 
 
Yes, I opened a client account about a week ago and completed the questionnaire about posting a job. I added my payment method and in order for up work to verify the payment they deducted two amount adding up to $10 which were to be reversed after I send them the deduction statements. After they deducted the amount, after a few hours I received a message informing me that my account had been permanently deactivated. 
 
I’ve no access to my previous client account, which was **Edited for Community Guidelines** . Currently I’m using a different one since this previous one was deactivated and I’m unable to access it.
 
My major complaint here is that my deducted $10 have not yet been reversed by up work. I made no hires so I feel that my amount should be reversed. I’ll be impressed if you consider my request in real time.

	A client is asking for free job and keeps pushing me into take communications out of Upwork

Like the title says a client is asking for free job and keeps pushing me into take communications out of Upwork. I refused and told her to make a call within the platform, I picked up and answer her questions, then she told me about her project. After we ended the call she asked me for a ""test"" wich is the whole job and it is unpaid, she send me the links to the raw footage and the website to which I need to upload the ""test"". I told her that I need to ensure a payment for my work and would need a contract to start working, to which she replied: ""Sure, I can do that later"" and proceeds to ask for my Skype id again.
 
I really don't wanna work with someone who's obviosuly a scammer, but I would like to get my connects back in order to apply to an actual job. By the way I asume she's asking for free work to several freelancers and then hire just one to legal up the project (see the screenshots), judging by her recent ""projects"" she's been scamming a decent number of freelancers and masking her activity by hiring just one (probably the cheapest) after some unlucky ones submit their ""test"".

I have created a job and have interviewed a few people who submitted proposals. However, because of some issues on our end, the job scope will change slightly which will obviously impact on the pricing and timeline of the people who submitted their proposals. Since these issues will take a month to resolve, is there a way to pause the job posting and re-open it in a month's time? If it is perfectly fine to keep it open for a month then no problem  I saw there is an option to remove the job posting but that is not my intention. I already invested alot of time interviewing a few candidates and will still like to offer the revised job scope to them. Thank you.

Top rated freelancers can remove one feedback every 3 months , and this is nice option for crazy clients.It will be useful if clients can do similar, and make some levels top rated clients or similar. I had very bad experience on last job, developer give me very low feedback only because that my "" code"" is old and he not like works with "" old"" code, he like fresh code. And this maybe can be logically, but he not works on fixed contract , then hourly and he charge this longer job , with my old code .  When freelancers have bad feedbacks they harder find work, similar is with clients , and it will be good option for client with good reputation to can remove feedback when working with indulge freelancers.

	Freelancer does not want to transfer store ownership in Shopify

Hi peeps! Freelancer just took my Shopify store hostage. He blackmailed/ threatened me yesterday he is not giving access unless I pay up. I cancelled contract just had the last straw. It's taking 2 months and still going so yesterday I said web dev is ok, just proceed to products loading (without edits, I said just load according to products of my site). He proceeded but wrong products. I said that's it, I am closing contract. Paid First milestone but not the completion. I mean, that's what milestones are for. If I am discontent/ unsatisfied it is my right to terminate. I paid the part which I think is OK but to threaten and blackmail a client is another level. Paid everything including subscription of Shopify ($70 not the basic because he gets commissions, he knows the drill) even with an unfinished store. He won't give me access now. I am shut off from my own store (first store unfortunately). He still keeps on modifying uploading ""now"" correct products. Just found out today. I am completely shut off and powerless. I still gave him 4.5 rating in here hoping that he can still go on working despite my bad experience. Please help. I am willing to lose my first milestone payment. I will deac my Shopify but this kind of attitude cannot continue. There must be something put in place. Thanks,May

	Is Upwork's messaging to clients inadequate? Causing problems?
","Oct 1, 2019  07:35:45 AM","
Is Upwork's messaging to clients inadequate? Is it causing too many serious problems for clients, and for freelancers? I have been wondering about this. I did NOT want to add to an existing thread created by any single client who came to the Forum with complaints about loss of money or time or other frustrations. This is DEFINITELY not about a single client. This is something I have been thinking about for quite some time, based on the complaints and threads of MANY different clients. I am concerned about how often I see clients post here in the Forum complaining about disappointing experiences while using Upwork. And when one looks into it, at the heart of the problem was serious misconceptions or misunderstanding on the part of the client. IN MY OWN work as a freelancer, I have run into major problems with clients who had serious misunderstandings about the nature of an hourly contract, and confused many aspects of such a contract with a fixed-price contract. It IS POSSIBLE that Upwork has done everything it can possibly do to help clients understand how the platform works, and to help them understand how they can use the platform successfully. But it is ALSO POSSIBLE that changes could be made to make it MORE LIKELY for clients to be successful here. It is all well and good to say ""they should have read the instructions."" But when so many clients are having such serious problems, I have to wonder if there is something more that can be done. Is there something more that Upwork could or shoud do? Is there something more that YOU do as a freelancer, that I could learn from? Does anybody have any suggestions?

Dear Upwork Team,
 
I was hiring a Freelancer for my advertised job, and while trying to understand how  the hiring works, accidentally paid in full to the Escrow through Paypal. I immediately received a paypal receipt of payment.
 
I had to set milestones agreed with the free lancer, and so I withdrew the offer and then  again with some google search, created milestones.
This time when I hired the same free lancer, I received another receipt from paypal for the milestone amount.
 
Please guide me as I think, Upwork will charge me each time when a milestone payment is to be made, while I have also made a full project amount payment already to the Escrow.
 
Here's the link to my advertised job:

Do not use **Edited for community guidelines**.  She is a SCAMMER.  I had a simple project.  Put the funds in escrow per the agreement for a fixed price job.  A very simple job of creating three HTML emails.  The freelancer IMMEDIATELY asked for more money before even starting the job.  When the final deliverables were due the refused to release them unless more money was paid.  Funds have been tied up in escrow as she will not complete the job or release the funds.  AVOID her at all cost!!

	Autofill keeps filling every contract I set up with my very first contract.
","Oct 15, 2019  05:16:40 AM","
I'm wondering if I'm the only person experiencing this. I've disabled all my autofills and for some reason every time I create a new milestone or new job the descriptions and titles overwrite with my very first project. When I hit the pay button on a milestone it replaces everything I typed in with my very first project. It's gotten to the point that every time I create a milestone or hit the pay button I have to copy the title before I hit pay so that I can change the title back to what it was before. It's very annoying and I feel like I've done everything on my end to remove autofill functions. Is anyone else having this problem?

I am a client who is looking for a freelancer. I was contacted by someone with many completed jobs and seemingly has earned a lot of money on UpWorthy. However, with the risk of sounding a little paranoid, their profile photo and name do not match how they sound when we spoke on the phone. (Their profile photo suggests they are a bald, white guy in Pennsylvania  but on the phone they sounded like someone calling from overseas with an extremely heavy Indian accent.) I suppose if they can do the work, I don't really care what they look like. But I am a little nervous about this - especially when they have asked for a Wordpress Admin login to research the project.  How should I proceed?

	Make the budget on fixed prices optional for clients!
","Jan 6, 2016  05:38:34 PM","
As a client I am really not happy by the fact that I have to specify a budget on my fixed price jobs posts. That's for two reasons, first I don't necessarily want to disclose my budget. In B&M business negotiations, I was never forced to disclose my budget. The second reason is that sometimes I have no frikkin idea about how much a task should cost. I don't like using low amounts as placeholder budget since some freelancers may disregard the job thinking it's my actual budget. I don't like using high amounts since I don't want the freelancers to align their price to it, even if they would have charged less otherwise. Freelancers know their business and their domain of expertise. They know what they should charge for a job, providing it's well described and I try as much as I can to give enough information in the job posting. Let them do the pricing, make the budget optional!

So it looks like Upwork has decided that there is money to be made in exchange rate conversions. We now have the ""great option"" to have our USD freelancer fees converted to local currency. Two questions that are totally unanswered by the help article:What is the rate at which USD will be converted to local currency? This makes rather a difference.If we want to opt out, how do we do this? I just tried, and my settings are already on USD. Of course the email says ""In the following weeks, Upwork will update your default credit card currency from USD to your local currency ..."" so I guess we have to keep logging in to check when this is done?

	Client is Changing Terms to Include Black Hat Practices and Non Payment

Hello,I've been working with a client for a few months now and it's been okay. They recently hired a new ""editor"" and have since ""restructured"" their model.  The new copy standards are entirely different from the original and include black hat practices (SEO stuffing) which don't read well at all. They also state they will not pay for assignments that need more than one revision. This seems pretty shady and puts them in a position to reject assignments, not pay, edit the work to their satisfaction, and continue using them. I've asked other freelance writer friends and they've said ""No way, drop them"". In my 10 years of copywriting, I've never experienced this. I intend to end the contract but am asking if they are allowed to do this on Upwork. Thank you.

	Punish irresponsible freelancers for wasting clients time!
","Oct 6, 2019  03:44:56 AM","
Hello,
 
At Upwork most of times-jobs I face to situation when irresponsible unprofessional freelancers takes my jobs and then cant finish job as it must be, as job was describe. They just do something about to 30-60% and stop work, waste time, etc.   
 
**Edited for Community Guidelines**
etc
 
At last task we agree that **Edited for Community Guidelines** will make 5 simple tasks-parts of one simple job for a 3-5days. (Professional should make it for a ~4hr.) But **Edited for Community Guidelines** from **Edited for Community Guidelines** ignored the job description and waste 3weeks to make only 2 tasks of 5 and even refuse to give those 2 tasks for a tests before paying!!! After 3 weeks he just end contract without give anything - so this **Edited for Community Guidelines** just waste 3 weeks of my time for nothing!!!
 
All those freelancers have your upwork rating near to 100%. So upwork rating just does not work and don't represent real freelancers reliability at all!!!
 
I ask upwork admin-developers to:
1) Bring back to me payment for a last job ($50) and bonuses ($20) that I give to a last freelancer **Edited for Community Guidelines** for a job ""**Edited for Community Guidelines**"" because I give bonus mistakenly 2 times (I was confused by upwork interface where bonus can be added at two different placed which also better to fix) - because last job he not complete at all and at previous job **Edited for Community Guidelines** also still dont finish the job - he add only 2 of 3 meta and even that second meta at SR have a wrong description. Also rating for a previous job will be nice to change from 5* to 3*.
 
2)  Such an irresponsible freelancers behavior are disgrace your site! UPwork must stop it by adding some penalty punishment that will be taken from a freelancers ""guaranty deposit"" - if freelancer will not finish job at all or will very let down they client by too much wasted time - freelancer will be punished and client will get compensation for a wasted time! (For example as at last job - 3 weeks for a NOTHING!   )
 
3) UPwork must automatically blocks possibility for freelancers to take more jobs when previous are not complete-finished! It can works automatically by giving possibility for a new freelancers or for freelancers with lower rating to take only 1 job, for freelancers with more then 10 jobs complete and rating near to 90% - to take 2 jobs, for freelancers with more then 50 jobs complete and rating near to 97-100% - to take 3 jobs, for a freelancers with more then 100 job and rating 99-100% and with accounts that works constantly for more then a 3years - to take up to 5 jobs, but not more any way. Also maybe with calculating of an overall jobs time, but still limit simultaneously jobs to 1-2-3-5.
 
Please, stop irresponsible behavior of freelancers at your site!

However, one of our translators recently had her account frozen for reasons that were not explained to her and seemingly will not be explained to her. This was extremely upsetting as a hirer because we lost one of our key contractors during a critical time of our project. It took us many weeks of back and forth and contractor trials before we found a group of translators that we could trust to do good work that was in line with our budget and expectations. Now it will cost us more time and money to find a replacement. A quick search brings up forums filled with similar experiences from contractors working on this site. Why did this happen to my contractor?

	I got scammed for $650, because the Developer cannot deal with criticism?!
","Oct 5, 2019  02:03:50 PM","
Hello, I requested a Twitter monitor, a program, which reposts tweets from twitter. The tweets should get reposted very quick. This one egyptian developer accepted my job offer and told me, that he can make a very stable programm, with a very low reposting delay. So I got convinced by his words and went with him, even though he wanted $650, but my job offer was only for $200. After 2 weeks or so he was ""done"". The program had a big reposting delay and he hasnt explained me how to use it probably.  The program was nowhere near the expectations that he gave me in the beginning, but it was okay, so I took it. (I just didnt wanted to deal with him anymore). I gave him a 6 stars review (which really did piss him off). Now, a few days later, I cannot use the program. Why? I have no clue. I let another freelancer from here look over the code. He found serious errors and suggested that the code was manipulated by the developer. What should I do? I just want my money back.

	Work diary question as a Client?
","Oct 1, 2019  02:08:41 PM","
I am reviewing the work diary of a Freelancer and it shows screenshots with a green bar.  That is, I assume, the time that I am being charged for.  But what are the grayed out sections?  For example, on the attached image it shows green from 2 AM until 3 AM, and then nothing until 3.50 AM.  What determines the time I am being charged for - is the Freelancer having to ""clock in"" or ""clock out"" in order for the time to be counted as billable?

	Big Discrepancy Between Transaction History, Mint, and My Spreadsheet

Hello everyone, Over the past few years I've been using Upwork, Mint, and spreadsheets to keep track of my Freelancers, what I spend on them, and the profit they bring in. The system worked for me, or so I thought. I've recently discovered there is a huge discrepency between what My spreadsheet (which doesn't account for trasnaction fees), mint, and Upwork's Transaction History page say I've paid my Freelancers.For example, if I do all of 2019 so far I get the following:Spreadsheet: $13,272.57Mint: $13,503Upwork: $16,080.66 (credit/debit) Can anyone help explain this?Does anyone recommend a better system? Thank you!

I've been regularly hiring new talent through UpWork. I posted a premium job and over 50 applicants all from the US applied. After interviewing over 8 of them, I found all of them were using fake accounts. They were all located off-shore. I do IP checks for every person I interview, I also request that they turn on their webcam. None of them would do it, they had thick accents, and IP's all showed outside of the US. @UpWork, please increase how often you audit accounts....

	Freelancer stole from me and upwork let it happen
","Sep 28, 2019  06:59:19 AM","
I just went through upwork dispute process for the first time. I’d funded an escrow milestone for $250, hiring a web developer to make login pages. The agency quoted 45 hours to get the job done, but eventually took a month. After 30 days the project sitill wasn’t completed and I asked for a refund. The freelancer disputed my refund request. Upwork looked into it and advised the freelancer to refund me, but they refused and instead paid their part for an arbitration, Which is $291.To me it’s illogical to pay $291 to get $250 back. But upwork has this rule that whoever pays the arbitration fee gets a refund if the other party doesn’t pay. If both parties pay then it’s non refundable.  The freelancer also violated my IP which is against the upwork terms and the dispute resolution specialist tells me that they’ve escalated the case for further investigation because the freelancer had evidently broken their terms of use. They ask for evidence and I send in screenshots some of which are right there in the upwork chat. I ask if if there’s anything else I can do during the investigation and I didn’t get a response back until 2 days later saying that my funds have now been released to the freelancer since I didn’t pay the arbitration fee but. I can file a claim if need be.  So upworks  dispute resolution process seems like a backdoor for fraudulent freelancers to steal money and get away with it . Meanwhile they keep writing stating they imagine how frustrating it is for me. And I’m like really? You just let freelancers steal so what’s there to imagine? has any client had a similar experience? What did you do or what do you recommend doing?

	Proper tax receipts from Upwork (when you file taxes for your business)
","Sep 28, 2019  02:00:39 PM","
I am a business owner and I have to report costs of tasks that I order on Upwork as business expenses when file annual taxes. I noticed that since Upwork absorbed Elance, the receipts that I get from Upwork billing section look a bit strange. I asked my accountant to review Upwork receipts and got this response: ""These receipts are a joke. They don't comply with IRS or Canada Revenue Agency regulations. If you get audited these expenses will not be accepted as valid business expenses for your company due to faulty receipts"".If you go to debit transactions and download your invoices you'll notice that your invoices only have freelancer's name but don't have an address (which is a requirement of tax authorities). While it has a ""remit to"" section with the address of Upwork in the bottom right corner, the Upwork is just intermediary, so this invoice will not be accepted by CRA or IRS.There is an option to use a funding request invoice from Upwork for tax purposes but it's illegal because it is not Upwork that is performing the service but a freelancer whose address you don't report... After speaking with my accountant I checked this with CRA but not IRS, though I am almost sure it's going to be the same answer.  Does anyone have an answer to this problem?

	Confused about Invites Sent/Unanswered invites
","Sep 7, 2017  09:51:55 AM","
Hello, I'm technically new to Upwork, since the last time I needed to hire freelancers it was Elance, and I am a bit confused about how invites work.  I posted a new job yesterday for a writer, made it ""invite only"", and invited about 15 people. I've received no feedback so far, but that's not what worries me. The thing is that when I chek the job, it only shows 2 of those 15 people both under ""Invited Freelancers"" and ""Unanswered Invites"". At first I thought the other invites didn't register, but when I checked the ""Saved Freelancers"" panel, the rest all had ""Invitation Sent"" and a checkmark next to their profiles.  Did the 13 other freelancers really get my invitation, if so, why are they not listed under ""Invited Freelancers""? Did they reject the invitation, if so, wasn't I supposed to get some kind of notification, since I have all boxes checked in my notification settings? Did I overdo it with the invites? I read a community post about too many invites being considered spam. If so, it was unintentional, as I am genuinely interested in all these writers, but some had a number of jobs in progress, and I just wanted to increase my chances of finding someone suitable for the project. I apologize if this has already been discussed before, I looked for similar threads but didn't find any. Florin

	Extortion by Upwork
","Sep 19, 2019  02:50:19 AM","
I have for the past few months been in ""dispute"" with Upwork over a recent contract that has ended in what is clearly extortion.   My freelancer completely refused to hand over work I had paid for as part of a milestone which in accordance with Upwork's terms and conditions was legally mine.  The freelancer would only release the work when all milestones were completed.  As Upwork was absolutely powerless to intervene I was left with no choice but to pay for all the milestones although the work was nowhere near completed.  This is extortion, through the Upwork platform. I have been in discussion with Upwork for months who refuse to confirm that work paid for as a Milestone belongs to the client.  With this in mind I would suggest anybody considering using Upwork seriously reconsiders as in reality your freelancer can do whatever they want and you left with no rights at all.  I would be very interested to learn of other similar cases.

	Why isn't Paypal allowed as a payment source
","Dec 8, 2015  08:29:44 AM","
Greetings, I am a Top Rated Frelancer on upwork but I would also like to use it as a client and hire freelancers to help me. There is just one ""little"" problem. I can't add Paypal as a payment option because I'm located in Romania. I can only add my credit card which would be a really big deal for me since I would lose a lot of money going back and forward between my bank and upwork. - I CAN add Paypal as a payment option in Romania in my FREELANCER settings but... - I CAN'T understand why I couldn't add Paypal as a payment option in Romania for my CLIENT account seeing how I already used it for over 2 years on Elance, without any problems.  So upwork doesn't have any problem in using my Paypal for Elance membership fees and other taxes but it won't allow me to use the same Paypal to pay freelancers... If you ask me, that's really weird.  UPDATE:08 dec.I have checked my PayPal account and it's VERIFIED.  ""You are now a Verified PayPal user. In addition to increased security, buyers and sellers value your Verified status because it indicates you have passed PayPal security checks. Most importantly, you can now send unlimited payments with your PayPal account."" Paying with credit card isn't really an option. For example, I'm getting most of my income through upwork. Here are the steps. 1) I withdraw money from upwork to Paypal. (1$ fee).2) Money goes into my account (I lose money due to currency fees and paypal 2 euro fee).3) I have to pay a freelancer on upwork (I lose money due to currency fees). When you add all the little fees you see it's not viable to use local currency cards to pay freelancers on upwork.

	Paying a secondary milestone - not the primary/current milestone
","Sep 12, 2019  01:40:39 PM","
Hi there- So I'd like to know if there is a way to pay a milestone that is not yet active but saved in Upwork. For example, we have 5-6 assignments for one of our writers. I create the first milestone, and it's active. Then I create the other 4-5 milestones which she will see once the 1st one is approved (by our secondary client) and can be paid. However, the way we work, I let her know of the pending milestones, so she can get working on those if she wants. Sometimes deadlines are so close, I need her to turn 2-3 assigments in around the same time. So the client may approve the 2nd milestone (not active) and I can pay my writer for that one but not the active one. But I can't because I have to pay the 1st, active milestone before I can pay the 2nd. I've already created 3 different contracts for this writer to help alleviate some of this, but it's still not enough. I'd rather not have a new contract for every job. She's doing 30-50/month. That would get crazy. Is there a way to pay subsequent milestones without paying the primary/active one? Hope this makes sense. Thanks for your help. FOR CLARIFICATION: The susequent milestones (post primary/active milestone) are active and funded - but they don't show to my writer until that 1st one is paid. Didn't want you to think I was just assigning something outside of Upwork without creating it in Upwork first.

						We'd awarded a contract to 1 engineering company after accepting their offer of 190 hours + 100 risk hours to complete a job. A company informed that 100 risk hours are required to safeguard their interest in the event more hours are required to finish the work. The company also refused to work on fixed term basis.Until this day, the company has charged us between 290-300 hours (amounting to some 10000$) and work completion is nowhere close to sight.I asked them to stop further booking and honor their commitment to accomplish all pending work. In return they came back informing they can't work for 'free'.They are asking for 100 more hours but at the same time are also informing that few of the tasks (which is critical to successful completion of this project) are excluded from these 100 hours and it can't be ascertained at this stage as to how many hours it'd take to complete those tasks. In principle, the company is asking for an open cheque.All this has led to delays in project delivery which inturn has forced us to keep deferring the project launch date.Would Upwork be able to intervene and help us on this matter?

However, when I click ""Hire"", an update billing method popup appears. I re-enter my card details, then it returns ""You already have this payment method on file"" - with a clickable link ""current payment methods"" which does nothing when clicked. I've used this visa business card several time and it's always worked. When I update the card in settings, it's fine, up until I click ""Hire"" again - then it displays ""Charge failed""..

	How to release balance after partial payment
","Sep 11, 2019  01:02:00 PM","
Hi. I recently completed a fixed price contract on which I had released a partial payment from escrow. Only 1 milestone was originally set up, and the full amount was in escrow. Now the job is complete, and I want to release the remaining funds to the artist. However, there is no ""review and pay"" button any more. If I add a new milestone, it asks for more money to be sent to escrow. How do I release the funds that are already there? Thanks in advance!  Kristen

	Budget on fixed price jobs sucks Upwork-style!
","Aug 31, 2019  06:10:46 AM","
Did I already said that the mandatory nature of the budget field sucks? I did. But now, it's getting worse... Posted a fixed price job yesterday. I have no idea how much it'll cost, so I put $5 and wrote at the top of the job that it's just a placeholder. It's an Intermediate job ($$). The category is said to be saturated on Upwork. My hiring rate is close to 100% and I have a rating of 4.96. Only good feedback, given and received. Six proposals so far. One removed by Upwork. Only newbies. I think that since people have to pay for connects, when they see $5, they don't bother. They think you're a cheapo. Upwork, it sucks that the budget is mandatory. It's stupid, beyond all logic and counter productive. It serves no purpose at all. I hate you.

	It ain't easy.
","Sep 9, 2019  04:37:06 PM","
Fellow clients, I'm reinventing myself for maybe the eighth or tenth time. I've been a management consultant for decades, and for the last ten years have written fiction as a hobbyist author. A book Ive been working on for about five years will be the inflection point for the next reinvention, as a writer of nostalgia targeting readers in the 55+ age range. I hired a social media guru on UW to make me smart on using social media. I can't use social media to create buzz or advertise until I have graphix. Can't do graphix until I complete the manuscript; will want a book-specific interactive web page to use for buzz/advertising/etc. So, I posted for an illustrator to do a cover and some other stuff to be used on social media and alerted my website pro to the need for a new website. I bought a website name. I also sent out some details on the work to the illustrator appplicants. I can't make any progress. It appears that website specialists make cold calls to the registered owner of every newly-registered domain name offering to build the website, make it SEO-perfect, help write the content, move in with me so they can cut my hair, replace my wife and kids and take over my life. I've received two months of phone calls today. Evidently, some of the illustrators interpreted the additional details as asking for free work. I've been inundated with messages, phone calls and texts this afternoon instructing me onToS and telling me why I can't ask for free work. The posting for illustrators was explicit that it was a heads-up and would not be awarded until mid-November. The illustrators all have questions about color, style, the feel of the book, offers to handle my social media, offers to do almost everything outsi.de of sexual favors. No to everyone. There is a reason I do most hiring on g***.com. I can't send general messages on UW to all applicants. So, I have to send seven separate messages each time. Wow.

	Freelancer manifests lack of focus and poor work quality while delivering project to other clients.
","Sep 6, 2019  09:26:16 AM","
Dear community,we have been active clients of odesk, elance and now Upwork and have been hiring many different freelancers with great results.In April 2019, we hired a very skilled .php programmer and provided him a very clear and detailed list of specs and graphic wireframe. The freelancer agreed to take the job and started with great performance, but after few milestones he manifested an increasing lack of focus to our project. We noticed this because he started to not performing fixes or changes we listed or by performing changes he wasn't supposed to or by not following previous decision we both agreed upon.The type of mistakes he makes clearly show distracion and lack of focus and we decided to wait to see if this was just temporary, sharing with Freelancer our feeling about the whole thing.Freelancer than replied our project is too big, he is alone and generally the cost of it would be much higher, but he was the one to approach us, make an economical request and agree to do the job for the money he was asking.We are sure his php skills are great, but we can't help but nothiching two important things:- from April 2019 our freelancer also accepted and delivered other projects to other UW clients (as per feedback on his profile)- the lack of focus he is manifesting to our project causes poor work quality on our project which means delays in launching our project which means a money loss from our side. This is not fare! Is there any way we can demand this Freelance to focus and concentrate to our project before taking other projects, so that he can finish the job and deliver what he agreed to deliver?Is there a time limit the Freelancer has to respect between milestones?Please advise.Regards

This is my second time hiring from Upwork. For the first time, I used Mastercard debitcard. There was no problem at all. But now I can't hire the freelancer and there is notification says 'There was a problem charging your billing method. Please enter a new billing method and try again'. I've tried to remove my billing method and re-add it many times but still didn't work. I also have contacted Upwork help team and the response was:**Edited for Community Guidelines**
I've checked all the information, try and try....the problem still occurs. I also replied to the Upwork team's email since 4 hours ago and there is no further response. It really makes me stressed because I need the work done by tomorrow and I've found the right candidate for this job.

	What's the best way to post a job with a fee per record structure?
","Sep 6, 2019  11:17:58 AM","
If you're posting a web research or data entry job, and you want to pay a fee per item, how exactly do you indicate this in a job posting? In case what I'm asking isn't clear, let's say you have a job where you want folks to build a list of beverage industry executives and their e-mail addresses.  For each beverage executive and e-mail address, you want to pay a certain amount, e.g. $0.10.  This obviously wouldn't be an hourly rate project.  But it also wouldn't really be a fixed fee project, since the amount the freelancer can early will vary depending on how many executives they find.  So I'm a bit confused about how to present this in the project description.

	Money refund from Escrow
","Aug 27, 2019  06:33:07 AM","
Hi everyone! I have a question. Last week I hired a copywriter (freelancer) for an article and set a fixed price of 120.00 USD. After the copywriter had sent me the article I sent it him back for mistakes correction. However, the copywriter had required first payment for the work done, otherwise he would not do anything. For that reason I paid him 60.00 USD as a bonus. Due to the fact that it was a bonus payment, the money was withdrawn not from escrow but from credit card. After the whole work had been done I paid the remaining 60.00 USD as miscellaneous payment. I explained the copywriter that those were the remaining 60.00 USD out of the total 120.00 USD. Today, on August 27, I ended the contract, but the request for payment is still opened. In order to end the contract I had to pay 0.01 USD, because I have already paid 120.00 USD, although from another source. Now the dispute is opened.I have a question if it is possible to get money back from Escrow. If not, then is it possible to spend money from escrow for another reasons (e.g. other articles ec.)

	Reporting tricky freelancer
","Aug 30, 2019  02:47:24 AM","
Hello UpWork community! Brand new on UpWork, I created 15 days ago my first job offer as a sourcing agent to locate producer or companys for 3 different products. I invited a freelancer with an interesting profile, good experience and references in this kind of job.He accepted my invitation right away and after a nice chat, we agreed about a fixed price of $100 for the mission. I was very excited having found the perfect guy for the job so I hired him. But just after getting hired, he ask me to send him a deposit directly on PayPal for his expenses, saying he will refund it to me later. Why not on the website? He said it would take ages for him to get the money and the researches had some costs. So I accepted because I thought that with all those good references and working since such a long time on Upwork, he deserved I trusted him! He was supposed to send me pictures of the products on Whatsapp and finish the work in the next 3 days. Well, I guess you know what happened next... Of course he never send any news neither pictures. At the end of the contract I asked him how his researches were going on and he finally replyed he had to go on some more markets to look for better prices.No news still and then 3 days later he required the payment on UpWork, attached to the work report a document with a few pictures of products obviously picked on internet, with a few prices. The products where not corresponding to my research and he gave me no company or producer name.I said I was not satified with the result but he claims he made the work and that the products I look for no longer exist. (Wich is wrong as I order them regulary to a local retailer...)I understood he tricked me so I asked him nicely to refund my money on PayPal. And if not I would have to report him. He replyed I was threatening him, so he won't refund no money but accept to end the contract on Upwork. I give you all the details so you understand the process of the trick. Obviously his goal was to get 50$ by PayPal, without making the job and without consequences on the website! He gives a false proof he made the work and I am the bad insatisfyed one who don't want to pay... But he is so nice that he accept to end the contract for nothing... So I cannot leave any bad feedback denouncing what he did. So he stays clean to the eyes of UpWork community and is able to keep riping off other beginners like me. Very smart!This need to stop. So I will report him and hope UpWork take the necessary measures against this person. Thank you for reading my story! Any advice or comment are welcome!Best regards, M. from France

	Low-balling, misleading bids on jobs
","Aug 29, 2019  06:50:35 AM","
I am rather disappointed that this keeps happening to me on Upwork. I post jobs that ask for an illustrator to do an illustration or two with some specifics, and I ask the artists bidding to provide examples of their work related to what I'm asking. I find an artist or two that I like based on their example artwork, and they've bid at or close to the budgeted price. When I message them about working on the project and point to something in their portfolio that they linked or an example image that they have provided, I'm told that that style or level of work isn't what I would get for the bid and I have to go with something simpler that either wasn't linked or wasn't stipulated in their bid.Is there a rule that artists must provide an example of the level of the work they will do for the price that they've bid, or at least, honor their bids if they link their entire portfolio and don't specify which part of their portfolio is the level of detail/style that they're offering with their bid? This seems to be very deceptive of artists to do and I've had to deal with it multiple times now.

I tried to set-up ""fixed pay"" with milestone payments; however, that doesn't quite work becuase the total number of leads (that will ultimately be provided) is unknown at the time of posting.

	Work doesn’t match the brief
","Aug 27, 2019  02:03:52 PM","
			
				
					
					
						HelloIt’s my first job on Upwork and I briefed a freelancer to create a logo and brand kit. I attached a detailed brief and set the deadline. I have now received the work and it hasn’t answered the brief at all or delivered half of what was asked. He himself admitted it’s one of his first jobs - I don’t think that his work will be in line with what I want for my job. I also don’t think the work submitted is reflective of my budget - although that’s admittedly small, the work l feels like it wasn’t designed for me but has been taken from another job. I have said all this and am worried as my project on my side is now falling behind. I would rather cancel the contract and walk away and rebrief someone else. Is it possible to release only some funds (day 10%)? I don’t want to pay the full amount when the work I asked for hasn’t been delivered and the portion that has is not at all right based on my brief. Please help

	Bug affecting invites from being received?
","Aug 27, 2019  10:24:35 AM","
Hi Everyone,  Is anyone aware of a bug affecting invitations from being received (or an issue with notifications)?I created a job last week and invited some very relevant freelancers (2 or so end of last week and another 3 yesterday.  I've spent close to 10k in the last year and a half on Upwork, exclusively through private jobs that I've invited freelancers to submit proposals for.  There haven't been replies from any of them.   The two that I sent the proposals to last week, each have $100k+ earnings on upwork, and my average hourly rate paid is in line with what they have indicated.  Similar situation with the three invited yesterday (one of those three invited yesterday actually was showing online/green when I sent the invite and for an hour afterwards, as well.   I'm not complaining about not getting replies (whether accepts or declines), and I realize that it hasn't been sooo long - just to not have a reply from ANY of the invitees is definitely very different from previous experiences that I've had so far.  Coupled with the fact that I'm not sure why I am able to send more than 3 invites for a single job (my understanding was the grandfathering for existing clients has ended, and I did not upgrade), and I thought that it may perhaps be a bug.   Oh, and apparently there have been some bugs with invites/notifications in the last year.

	Indian Client : TDS And GST Implication. Gross up ? Percentage? and so on.
","Sep 18, 2017  08:34:38 AM","
Hello, We are a firm based in India and we have a very dense workflow culture through upwork. We spend about 20,000USD on foreign payments through upwork per month. However we have been told by our chartered accountants, that we need to collect the (Indian PAN Card - if that is not available then No Permanent establishment certificate (NO PE Certificate) and form 10F) from the party we are paying to in order to get 20.6% TDS. If no document is provided at all we have to incur TDS of 40%.If we are also able to provide PAN then 10% So under these circumstances, we reached out to upwork through their support chat to get upwork itself to fill form 10F and NO PE since upwork is the party we pay to and they in return distribute it among the developers through (escrow / hourly payments) so on and so forth. However upwork responded to our request saying the following : ""unfortunately as per advise, Upwork is not allowed to sign any documents related to tax issues since there is no requirements from our government."" So now since there was such a strong disregard from upwork's end, I believe other Indian clients must have faced similar issues in Indian Tax system, so we wanted to know what work-around or way out is there for an Indian client getting services from foreign nationals without Indian PAN card through upwork.

	How does the refund process work when contract not accepted then withdrawn
","Aug 23, 2019  03:23:57 AM","
Hi,I have been using UpWork for a while now, and have hired many Freelancers successfully. I am very unhappy about the process on Upwork, when a contract is set up. I listed a job, for a Freelancer to contact me to say he had a 'Special' team of Freelancers. (It was only a small job) Then promised me he could do the work. So we agreed a price. So i set up the contract and offered this Freelancer the job.. For the agreed price.The freelancer didn't accept the contract or job. As he said he now could not do the job. And then said he would need 5 days to carry out the small job, then said if i wanted him to do it, then it would cost 4 times the amount already agreed.As he didn't accept the contract, I was immediately able to withdraw the contract. Then I got a notification to say the money taken into Escow would be refunded. I am very disappointed with this, as i now have to wait 3-5 working days for the money I have already paid into Escow. to be refunded. (Aswel as a fee being taken by UpWork, to refund me the money.) So now I have to wait for the money to be refunded back into my account. So I can then Re-Set this job back up, for Upwork to 'Again' take the money, into Escow. This could happen repeatedly. There seems to be all the protection for Freelancers, but little for Clients. Why isn't there an option, when withdrawing a job or contract to hold the money into Escow, so it's there, when you find another freelancer who can actually follow through with the 'Promises' they have made. As mentioned, I have had numerous successful jobs done on Upwork, but have also had to go through this same process numerous times, for the work i wanted carried out to be delayed. Due to being messed around by a freelancer. My website is non - profitable, and is a free website. So when i save up money, to pay to improve my website, it's super easy for a client to be messed around by a Freelancer, to then have their work hugely delayed, due to this issue. Then be charged for it. I think this is a really bad flaw. And really puts me off adding more jobs on Upwork now. It would be so much easier, and better, if there was an option to hold the funds in Escow, then when you want to hire a freelancer, for the same job to be carried out, to then use them funds in Escow. So i am being repeatedly charged, for a refund process, through no fault of my own? I am now really sceptical, to add any more jobs on Upwork, and it's really disheartening, as I think it is an awesome website, and way to get super talented Freelancers to carry out work, a client needs. It's also a shame for the genuine good freelancers, who do a great job, at what they do. Very unhappy about this process, and raised the same issue a while back, when it last happened, to get no response back, or for this to be looked into. Sorry if this sounds a little extreme, but when you save up money, to improve your site, and then get promises, that a flake can deliver, to then say 'Oh I can't do this now' to then have the job delayed by at least another week, before the refund process is completed. To then not know for sure whether the exact same thing is going to happen. Regard's

My freelancer filed a dispute to me for a work I just commissioned. I received a message from Upwork on Jun 16 saying that they would follow up with me via email within 5 days. If we couldn't resolve the issue then the issue might go to Arbitration. On Jun 16, I replied on the Upwork dispute centre on its web site saying that I would be willing for this dispute to go to arbitration. On Jun 21, I received email saying that my money held in escrow account had been released to the freelancer because i had made no response. I inquired with Upwork and was told the dispute handling team only dealt with disputes via email. I further found out that the dispute handling person from upwork knew my message post on the web site, but ignored it simply because it's not in the email. I feel helpless. There is no message nor any instruction on the web site saying that you can only communicate/reponse to a dispute through email. To a user, leaving reponses in upwork Dispute message centre seems a perfectly legitimate way to reponse. I don't understand the logic which some arbitrary rule about using email trumps common sense. Since the person knew my reponse on the web site, how can he conclude I made no response.

	How can I get a refund for work not completed by unethical freelancer?
","Aug 22, 2019  08:52:54 PM","
Hi everyone,  I'm hoping someone can help as I am getting lost in a sea of legal words and am hearing nothing from the freelancer I hired, nor UpWork. I hired an agency to complete a project. Yet, after several delays - approaching three times the timeframe the freelancer originally supplied - the project has not progressed. It appears that they do not have the skills to complete the project so are just delaying and delaying, promising fixes, wasting more time, etc. I have now asked for a full refund for the project from the freelancer so that I can hire another supplier with the skills necessary. However, I haven't heard anything in response. Nor have I heard from UpWork, who I also messaged. I have part of the total amount in the fixed-price contract -  US $2K from US $3.5K which is incidentally all of the my own money I had saved for this project. As far as I can tell this is not in Escrow. So my question is, can I get this money refunded? The freelancer has clearly been unethical taking a project on that they cannot complete and now this may have ruined me. Do they really get to keep the money after delivering nothing? I am very worried that all of my money will be lost. And this project was being completed as part of a charity organisation I am affiliated with. Quite a devastating outcome. Anna

	Invoice question - EU company
","Aug 16, 2019  04:28:47 AM","
Hi guys, I'm new to Upwork and I have a question regarding invoices. I hope you can help me out. I have a company in the EU and I would like to hire a freelancer from a non-EU country through Upwork. I have read a couple of topics about invoicing / billing, and I noticed that when it comes to billing, Upwork is creating the invoice in the name of  the freelancer, so the invoice has the name and address of the freelancer, invoice number and the client's company details. My question is if these invoices are completely legal? As an EU company I would like to use them for my book-keeping / my records and want to be sure if the tax authority checks them, I won't be in trouble. Any help would be much appreciated! Thanks,Adam

	Freelancer Unable to Perform Coding Required - Dispute?
","Jul 12, 2019  11:38:34 AM","
This is my first time using UpWork and I posted a job to have a code developed which contained specific details and requirements.  The Freelancer I hired had a high rating (+85%), and was confident that he had the experience to complete the task.  A deadline was set for 1 week.  After 9 days, I received the code, however it did not function properly (not even close to the original request).  I discussed with the freelancer, and he did mention he was having a few issues.  The freelancer suggested I pay an additional amount, in order to create a second code, which would provide a visual representation for the original code requests.  This would benefited both of us, as I would be able to monitor ""alerts"" created by the first code visually, and it would assist the freelancer with the programming of the first code.  After two weeks, I received the second code, however it does not work properly either.  It has now been over a month of back and forth troubleshooting, and we are still relatively at the same place as when the original code was created.  It is obvious that the freelancer does not have the required skills to complete the job.  I think it's possible that because the jobs were at a fixed price, and the freelancer is struggling, that they may have lost the ambition/desire to either complete the task, or agree to move on from the project.  As this job was based on a fixed-price, and the funds are currently in escrow, what options do I have?   I would just like to get the code I originally requested built.

	Using Upwork in while trying to meet contract requirements of my company
","Aug 15, 2019  09:53:01 AM","
I work for a large company that has a massive and fully involved Supply and Contract Organization.  This organization at my company manages all contracts and issues all purchase orders as well as handles all billing for any contract issued at the company.  Additionally, contract language for all contracts issued is tightly controlled and all vendors have to go through a screening process (including a background investigation) to be able to work for my company as well as fill out company-specific NDA paperwork and other fun attachments.  I can't imagine Upwork has not dealt with these issues from other large companies, however I have not been able to find any relevant articles on the subject.  Can Upwork provide some help with regards to this?  I am very intested in hiring some of the freelancers that are on this site, however I don't see a good way to marry what seems like a simplified process for hiring freelancers and large company contract management requirements.

I have found that in hiriing that there are too many **edited for Community Guidelines** on the platform that are at reasonable fee's, but compared to code quality and timeframe i have constantly gotten outragious timeframe to complete like 30 days to 2-3 months for a  a simple plugin , or 20,000 dollars to build a product add-on for woocoemrce.
Compared to **edited for Community Guidelines** are way better reaonable fee's and time frame is way shorter- i believe the **edited for Community Guidelines** use the hourly to max out hours and extort clients. i think upworks should bring back text for quality of code , as there are too many devs who can't code not are unable to understant the job posts.

						As it was my first time on the platform I mistakenly issued a proposal for $300 (not realising this wasn’t in my currency of AUD). I quickly withdrew this before my contractor accepted, and reissued a new proposal with the correct amount (which was accepted)However the original $300 USD charge remains as pending on my credit card (this was on August 5, so more than 5 business days have passed)Is this likely to be based on my credit cards timelines rather than an error on Upworks side? Can an Upwork team member please confirm I have not been charged for this?Thanks !

	Freelancer has been delaying completion of project for almost a year. Money is gone. No code to show
","Aug 7, 2019  01:45:46 PM","
I hired someone at the end of 2017 if memory serves me to develop a framework for a website that I had been wanting to setup for quite some time. The individual I hired understood the project very well and finished it within a few months. He deployed the projec to AWS and left the rest of it in his repo. At the time, I wasn't familiar with what a repo was and why it was necessary. Fast forward months and I hired him to do an update with a few additional forms on the site, nothing crazy. I believe this was September of 2018. It's now August of 2019 and I haven't had anything updated, I dont have access to the code, the AWS server that it was on no longer exists and I am out the money I spent to have this done. He answers my emails regularly, he even engages me asking for this/that (SSL admin, updated forms, clarification on certain things), most of which are the items needed to close this out. I have asked him repeatedly to push the code to my repo or to the new AWS server I setup for this. He continues to tell me that 'it's almost done, deploying Friday'. I've seen video of him using it natively on his computer and it looks/works as is. He even redid the front end of the interface to make it match the website... something I didnt' ask or pay him to do. Everything tells me he's almsot done, but due to where he lives (the country) and some person issues in his life, this is definitely not on his priority list. It's been two years since I initiated this contract with him and I have nothing to show for it. Its the same developer for both sprints... but since he took the site down on sprint 2, I have literally nothing. No code. No acitve website. Nothing. I would have to start over from scratch to get anything done.  What are my options here?  I'm in the US, hes in the middle east.

	My Freelancer Keeps Switching Accounts
","Aug 6, 2019  08:48:53 AM","
I have a freelancer hired to boost my social media accounts, and she is doing a great job. My only concern is that twice now she has run into a situation where she apparently has technical trouble with her account, so she refunds me all the money I have paid, and asks me to create a milestone with the total sum on another account that her ""associate"" runs. The work then continues on that account. I have done so both times without any issues. I don't see how I am being scammed because Upwork refunds me the money and I pay it forward to the new freelancer account. If this person is legitimately having issues with their account, I don't mind helping them out. However, the names for these accounts are fairly generic, and I am certain it is the same person creating multiple accounts. I just can't tell if they are driven to doing this because of problems with Upwork, or if they are doing something they shouldn't. Anyone run into this before?

Created a fixed-price contract with a freelancer, and when he added milestones with partial payments involved, it took the original fixed fee offer, and then added the milestone costs (which were just parts of the overall fixed fee offer) and added them together. So a $2k fixed contract became a $4k contract.  Any idea how I can resolve this? I want there to be four milestones with payments along the way, but cannot figure out how to remove the initial $2,000 that was offered.

	I have been scammed by a freelancer and the person in the mediation team is doing an horrible job
","Aug 1, 2019  02:46:16 PM","
I have been scammed by a freelancer and upwork is not helping me even worst the person in charge is making it worst which makes me want to take legal action against upwork. I hired someone on upwork to work on developing a website. I gave the freelancer crystal clear instruction he had to do a website that is an exact copy of another one. He kept showing us work that was 10% done and was barely working. We kept asking the freelancer when he will be done and deliver the final version. He kept claiming he is working on it and will deliver at a later date. When suddenly I noticed that the money that was in escrow was released to him because the freelancer has marked the work as completed and payment was released to him. We realized later that we have only recieved one email from upwork that the money will be released if we didn't act. Once I realized that the freelancer got paid and hasn't delivered anything I rushed to speak to the customer support to ask them to hold the fund and make him unable to withdraw until someone had proper time to review the case. Any sane person who will look at it will realize that we have been scammed. I also reached out to the freelancer and told him that he now got paid but he clearly knows that he hasn't delivered anything. He claimed that he was still working on it and would deliver by the end of the weekend. At the end of the weekend the freelancer still didn't deliver anything. The customer support told me that only the dispute team was able to put a block on his ability to withdraw and they will look at the case before he has the ability to withdraw the money. The case has now moved to the dispute center and the mediator from upwork is doing a terrible job making the case even worse. When the dispute started the freelancer claimed to have delivered and showed a ridiculus barely working website that was not even 10% completed. I told him that he could avoid this whole dispute by putting the money back in escrow and finishing the website which he refused. What is outrageous is that upwork can clearly see from our conversation that he hasn't delivered anything and what he sent as his proof of work was sent to us months ago and he kept claiming that he is working on it and will deliver soon. When I say that to the mediator she kept claiming the he acted according to upwork TOS. Really? Does upwork TOS enable freelancer to charge money without delivering anything or any work? Lying to the clients? Misleading? Scamming? Extorting? I am being asked to pay for arbitration but they would not tell me if he has withdrew the money which is insane how can you claim money from someone if you have no ability to get it back after you pay an additional fee. But worst of all the mediator refuse to answer the questions I am asking him purpusefully ignore them and replies within long period of time like if he was trying to delay it as much as possible. It has now been over a week that I have asked them to charge my card and proceed to arbitration and they still haven't done so. I have asked the mediator to speak to his supervisor but also didn't get any answer. Even worse I'm getting answer that are completely absurd any time I ask something. What can I do? Who can I speak with? Has anybody here taken legal action against upwork because they were responsible for them getting scammed? Also this delay is costing me a lot of money. Can I legally make upwork pay for it? Any help is appreciated.

	Agency being shady providing credentials to website
","Aug 5, 2019  12:18:37 PM","
Hi there,I found some bits and pieces on Google but wanted to create a thread to inquire. I had no idea what I was really doing back when I started this project. I dont have the FTP / SQL credentials as they are stored at the Agency I hired through upwork.  I am requesting the company send me my login details so my friend can review, but they are now being very shady and validating what my friend basically assumed was going on. I realize I may have over paid which i dont mind I just want the final project.  If I dont get my login details in the next 24 hours, where can I create a ticket? I think this is the most unprofessional thing and I left this company many good reviews. In a way its also my fault not having the login details (recently started learning internet security and I'm setting up my virtual machines etc.) Cliff notes1) started a project back in september 20172) project took a break in june 2018 (code)3) project started again November 2018 (design)4) project finished design (june 2019)5) project on its last hurdle (code) (July 2019)6) friend works as a software consultant - wants to review the code (aug 2019) -  claims the rate is being over charged now. Regardless of the time it has taken to build the project, it still would have been cheaper than building it in Canada. 7) asked for company to create a partition so my friend can review the code 8) did not receive the FTP partition so my friend can review the code. I told the Agency I know they took a long time doing tasks, but I dont mind cause it still would have been cheaper than building it in Canada. 9) Whats the procedure getting my logins and making sure they deliver without trying to screw me over (example: they provide a previous backup out of spite) Edit: I have about one more payment I will send them and that's it. I know how much is completed and it is only a little bit more left to do. I imagine before I send the final payment, I will request everything including logins so I can transfer them somewhere else if needed

I asked them some weeks ago about why I get permanently same mails about new offers, even I already got these mails for all candidates.Also upwork recommended me a freelancer to look at, what I did, however this freelancer was not ""top"" at all and just applied without having time. I reported this to upwork and asked for feedback, never got any answer.

	PayPal  payment unsuccessful
","Jan 19, 2018  02:20:56 AM","
I set PayPal as my primary payment method, backed by my bank account. (All in the UK) That's my standard payment setting for almost all products and services I buy. But this week's payment was unsuccessful.Customer support directed me to contacted PP, which I did twice. Naturally nothing useful was said or done by either PP or upwork support. In fact, upwork support  has been shining by their absence for at least 24 hours now.I get the impression that upwork wants to railroad users into using cards and paying more that way. That's why I only back my PP with my bank account. I have left my card out of it. But I need to know for certain, if I did back PP with my debit card, would I get the added fees too? Or does the use of PP provide a layer of protection against that? To add insult to injury, while ignoring my support requests, they did block my account for not paying, despite multiple attempts to make things right.The freelancer also sent me a screenshot with the outstanding balance, but with next Wednesday's date. If that's the default, why am I being penalised? Would I even be able to pay before then, assuming the real problem is identified and fixed?I want to to hire this freelancer on a permanent basis. And this issue is not only holding up my project but might alienate a treasure of an assistant.

	Client (Me) Pay for one milestone, then wait to activate the next?
","Aug 3, 2019  09:57:13 PM","
Hi lovely freelancers and clients! Today I accidentally used a feature I've been looking for and wondering about! How do I do it on purpose? I'm principally using upwork right now to hire for designing images on cards... there are many cards. I would like to be able to pay for a milestone (single card usually) then leave the contract open, and not have to do a brief/setup/assignment/selection based on card-options + artist style >right then at that moment<... why? Because I really want to pay the client ASAP when they give me the final PSD after I've reviewed it! Then, on my own time I can make the new milestone (like the next day, or maybe two or four days) >later<. Why? So, then I'm not under my own ethical pressure to setup the next milestone >before< clicking the pay button! Like, I didn't necessarily want to be writing about this on my Saturday night! Not that I have anything better to do... except sleep of course! I'm exhausted! (Suck it up man!) [okay! Go!] Guess what! You can DO THIS! But how? Tonight, i was just clicking through they payment screens, getting ready to copy and paste or paraphrase a ""brief"" (description of art requested to be crafted by a fantastic illustrator) for the next milestone... and KABOOOM! There was no such screen! I said, pay now, release funds, continue contract... but then nothing! So I went to the contract page, Pay now was greyed out, but there wasn't a ""Rehire"" button... interesting right? I went to the ""All Contracts"" page and... alas... the ""Activate a Milestone"" button was there instead of the Pay Now or Rehire button! So... can I do this on purpose? The support bot wasn't any help just now... Please note, my primary criticism of the upwork platform as a client is there are perhaps too many ways to get to very similar, but not identical pages/options of information in many different but similar presentations. I would like a centralised (sp? am I British or American, too tired to tell) hub, and the hot options / buttons available from more of the nearly identical screens so that their differences are rendered pretty nominal instead of things like the above... Cheers, Happy Saturday night from Pacific Daylight Time

	How to resume an ended contract

I ended a contract because I realized I needed to work on the document that I wanted to have translated. I was alerted by the Freelancer that by ending the contract and requesting a refund from escrow I would be lowering her rating. I'd like to resume that contract to prevent this from happening, I assumed that because I originalty assigned the due date for 8/4 that I had to cancel that contract in order to set a new one with a later date. How do I fix this so her rating doesn't go down?

Hey all,I'm pretty new here so bear with me please. I am trying to get some bids on an app I am developing and have no idea how much it's worth. I am looking for a developer who is proficient in Swift. The app is a medium sized walled garden educational app. It includes a forum, spendable in app ""points"", lessons, and quizzes. I have it pretty well designed and the features all hammered out, I just need someone to turn our ideas into a functional app. There isn't anything really ground breaking about the design of the app, so I don't imagine that it would be a huge undertaking.  Thanks in advance for any help.

	How to Pay out money in escrow when there is no milestone attached to it.
","Jul 26, 2019  10:57:49 AM","
I have $25 in escrow I want to pay out to the freelancer. But, there is not milestone attached to it anymore. Not sure why.I could create a milestone and fund it for $25. Will it use the $25 in escrow or charge me another $25? Which will just put me in the same position.I also looked at paying a bonus, but, again, I don't know if it's going to use my escrow money or charge me extra money and leave my escrow where it is. It's weird because all my other contractors, I can just pay out what is in escrow for the milestone they completed. But, for some reason, with one of my contractors, I don't have that option. How can I pay out what is in escrow to a particular contractor if I have no milestone attached, without adding more money?

Did you know, that developer can blackmail you to give him Top Rate and even if  Upwork clearly know about blackmailing, Upwork will not support you ever? 
We know all this by our 4 month experience in Upwork. 
We blackmailed and payed  2.365 USD instead agreed 1.000 USD and get  for 50% work done - NO SUPPORT from UPWORK!! 
 
Please Be CAREFULL ! Do not make mistake that we did.

11.06.2019 Asked help from Upwork
18.06.2019 No help recieved, so we lounched disput 
Developer didnt give us code for other 3 pieces, that was payed, it's 3 month after deadline!  He start to blackmail us 

Requested to stop disput
Give him good feadback 
Create new milestone for 750 USD for 3 already payed but not delivered pieces  

We canceled disput, as we need codes, created milestone for 250 USD for 1of the piece
28.06.2019 Developer canceled contract 
28.06.2019 Developer received our 250 USD and refused delivering codes.
3.07.2019 We asked supoprt from Upwork, that we not ready to pay, it's blackmailing - NO SUPPORT from UPWORK  they told they can not do nothing and let us to follow his blackmailing if we need codes. 
12.07.2019 We forced to give him good feadback, to create new contract and put 750 USD to be able to recieve 1 of the 3 pieces! Please remember, that this was already payed 5.05.2019 but not delivered to us. He blackmail over payment, Upwork know it and didn't support us!! 
15.07.2019 We payed 750 USD and recieved piece #2 from 4  ( 250 USD + 750 USD = 1000 USD additional blackmailed overpayment for work that was already payed 5.05.2019 ) 50% work and 200% payment great! 
 
We contacted UPWORK again, they said it's Top Rated developer he have power to delete our bad feadback, that we left him after second overpayment. Today i went  to our correspondence with developer all mesages with blackmailing messages WAS DELETED!!! All what i have picture from the screeen that i've made when we start to complaine to support team. Upwork literally supporting criminal developer, developer have power

to recieve money without delivering work 
delete bad feadbacks

	Declined interviews
","Jul 25, 2019  09:14:22 AM","
Since Upwork now limits the number of invites a client can send out for no extra cost, I wonder if any consideration has been given to crediting clients for those invites when the freelancer declines the interview. It would work like a freelancer's connects being returned when the project is cancelled.Or maybe this being done I just don't know about it. This occurred to me when I once again declined an interview for a project that doesn't interest me. I'm a PHP programmer and regularly get invites for WordPress projects. WordPress is written in PHP but I have no interest in working with it. I've considered adding a line to my profile that basically says ""I don't do WordPress, so save your invites.""

	Are there no reporting capabilities for an Upwork Client unless you pay for Upwork Plus?
","Jul 22, 2019  06:23:55 PM","
I am both an Upwork client and a freelancer. As an Upwork freelancer, I am able to pull detailed invoices and reports for financial bookeeping purposes on my income. I need to do the same as an Upwork client, as these transactions represent my expenses for my business. It seems that every report I try to access as an Upwork Client requires Upwork Plus, the paid version of Upwork. I feel like I am missing something. There must be some basic reporting as part of the free Upwork plan so that you can do some basic financial reporting on the work clients hire out to freelancers.  All I can seem to find is time billed by freelancer (timesheet type information). Help!

	Add Freelancers Internet Speed
","Jul 24, 2019  01:31:24 PM","
Upwork should totally have an internal engine that constantly checks the internet speed of the freelancer and automatically updates it based on their profile. Main reason is we want to know as clients who we are hiring, if this freelancer has an unstable internet connection to accomplish the work.  Web developer especially are building using an online framework.  Many cases freelancers say their internet was down and they use this excuse so often when in reality they are just taking vacations. In the internet space, online stability and speed is equivalent as someone showing up for work in a corp office.  What value is it to a client if a pro developer has constant low connection or unstable internet speeds. Recorded IP addresses should also be internal to avoid someone claiming they are from the US when in fact they are from somewhere else.

	Job Incomplete - How Long After a Milestone Does Upwork Refund Monies
","Jul 22, 2019  06:53:44 PM","
A Freelancers bidded on my project for a realtime App.  He accepted my job on 23 May, 2 months ago from today and said the App would be complete on June 6.  On 21st July he quickly makes an Admin Panel for the App and sent me the URL link and before I could blink he was requesting I release the payment for his work.  I immediately refused stating I was just looking over the admin panel, had some concerns I would like to discuss and have not even seen the functioning of the realtime App.  I could not tell you if this App existed at this stage as I only saw screen shots of a few pages.  I requested to see the a long time ago and he sent me screen shots of some sort of coding.  Most of my requests went unanswered and were ignored. He was in quite a haste to upload this App to my Google Play Account and rushed me to write a description and add images.  I drafted a description but obviously had not images as he had only shared the login screen, registration page and Job page.  I requested he send me some images from the delivery drivers point of view, after all it was a delivery driver app and I wanted drivers to see the screens prior to downloading the app.  He ignored me.  Eventually after he began overlooking my questions and I noticed there was no Map view in the Admin Panel, I queried where it was and he informed me it did not exist.  I asked how I was supposed to track a delivery driver should a customer contact me and ask and he completely ignored me.  I then asked about the Map view in the delivery driver app and he stated there was none, driver clicks when he is ready to collect order and customer is notified through my website and driver clicks enroute to customer and customer is again notified through my website.  So I queried how the driver was supposed to navigate from Pickup to Drop off and he could not answer... I was frustrated at this point as I had waited almost 8 weeks for what I thought was an Uber-like delivery app and he could not explain what was realtime about it.  My Job description clearly said Uber-like delivery app.  He advised me he would create some sort of link for me to send to customers for them to track their delivery but this was never mentioned of again. I requested a refund and he disputed this so we are now in mediation.  The Freelancers is telling Upworks that he shared the code with me since he uploaded it to my Google Play Account but I never saw the code and I honestly have no use for his App and would not use it.  This Freelancer has done works for me that I am willing to pay for, however there are works that we never discussed payment for that he is now putting a price on and due to my time being wasted and him unrestricting my site (behind my back after I advised him not to) I think I should be able to. I am trying to understand why he began rushing for payment and beginning to think Upworks was going to automatically refund my money as the milestone due date was June 6 and it was now July 21, he had over-run this time. Does Upwork automatically refund clients if a Job has not completed within the milestone period?  If so, how long after the milestone period has exceeded does Upworks automatically refund payment? I must admit I am feeling ripped off at this point because I was under the impression during the mediation, there would be an investigation i.e. look at the Contract Job, Proposal and the messages but instead they want us to email back and forth to meet some common ground.  I really do not have any time for this as I have wasted enough time waiting for an Uber-like app.  I have lost all trust in Upwork.

	Freelancer profiles with identical content

I'm currently recruiting for several new freelancers. When browsing profiles looking for potential freelancers to invite to one of my active job posts, I discovered two which have a nearly identical first paragraph. It is too specific for it to be a coincidence. I have flagged both their profiles for plagiarised content and linked to the other person in each report, but I'm wondering if there's anything else I can, or should, do? UPDATE: One of them has now applied for my job. I'm considering asking them if they're aware of this other profile and why some of their content is identical, but I don't know which one is the ""bad guy"" here and I don't want to either scare off the plagiarised person or alert the plagiariser.

	Is it possible to leave feedback for freelancer who backs out after contract starts?
","Jul 21, 2019  07:35:00 AM","
Is it possible to leave feedback for freelancer who backs out after contract starts? Certainly there should be some way to warn other clients of potential redflags.
 
June 23 - Hired freelancer with an agreement to start July 15. I starting putting things in place ahead of time for him - some of which had a cost associated such as licenses to my CRM and company email. He specifically wanted to acquaint himself with Pipedrive.
 
June 30- All was well at this point and the freelancer expressed interest in having a conversation ahead of time so he could prepare. We exchanged messages over the coming week.
 
July 7 - I reached out to the freelancer to inquire about his availability for the coming day, and also to give him the Pipedrive credentials for his account.
 
July 8 - The freelancer responded to confirm that we would speak at 1:00 that same day. At that time he didn't answer my call. He didn't respond or acknoweldge the follow up voicemail and Upwork messages left for him. At this point I started to have reservations, but considering the contract didn't start until July 15 I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt.
 
July 9 - I sent another message inquiring about his availability. No response.
 
July 11 - Another message was sent, with a reminder that we were scheduled to begin on the following Monday. The freelancer repsonded overnight stating that he would be ready for a call anytime after 3:00PM that day. I responded in the morning asking if 5:00PM would work. He didn't respond. I called at 5:00 and left a voicemail, and followed up with another message via Upwork. No response was received.
 
July 14 - I sent a message preparing freelancer for his July 15 start date.
 
July 15 - Freelancer sent a weird message that said **Edited for Community Guidelines** I sent one more message asking when he'd be ready to start; since he missed our first two calls, I offered to schedule another call. Freelancer stopped responding.
 
July 16 - I sent the freelancer a message telling him that we were having trouble connecting. I pointedly asked him if he was still available to work on the project. **Edited for Community Guidelines**
 
I ended the contract without paying the freelancer (he didn't perform any work).
 
This is ridiculous. I've now lost a month due to this guy, as I try to find another freelancer who can handle this job. Certainly there has to be a way to warn people of this, right?

I received an email impying that I offered to pay or paid a freelancer outside of Upwork. I have one project posted. I hired a freelancer who blew off scheduled phone calls, was unresponsive, and just today backed out of the project that was supposed to start yesterday. I never offered to pay him (or anyone else) outside of Upwork, but this guy, for reasons unknown to me, sent me a message yesterday asking if I tried to pay him via PayPal. He then said he sent that message in error, despite referring to me by name in that same message. I have no clue if this is related to that strange chat exchange, but I'd really like an explanation. I did not offer to pay him (or anyone else) off the platform. I extended an offer to another freelancer, but now my account is in limbo while I wait for Trust and Safety to respond to my email (I replied to their suspension email within moments of receiving it). This is beyond frustrating. If there's anyone with Upwork who can escalate this I would appreciate it. As it is, I've lost three weeks thanks to a freelancer stringing me along until bailing out when asked, now this. I've already contacted chat, but they apparently had no means of contacting T&S.

There is a freelancer I met some time ago when she applied to one of the jobs I posted on Upwork, and I saved her profile for the future. I just discussed a new gig with her today and I would like to hire her, but unfortunately, she told me that her account is on hold and I can't hire her. I didn't really understand what the reason is, but she seems like a perfect match for the gig I'm after, and she mentioned that she doesn't know how long would it take for her account to be restored again. I don't want to work with the freelancer off-platform, because obviously, this breaks the ToS, but will this still be the case when the freelancer's account is suspended? In other words, I seriously need to start the gig with this freelancer as fast as possible, but Upwork does not allow her to do any work on the platform. What can I do in this case? Am I good to work with her off-platform until her account is restored?On a side note, is there a way I can determine why her account is put on hold? Just to make sure I don't fall into any issues.

	Client Cancelled Contract then Apologizes. What should i do?
","Jul 10, 2019  10:53:44 AM","
So i applied to a project on Sunday, were i had to do a minor audio editing job. In my proposal i sent the client a test demo of what he already needed. He said the demo reflects what he wants, and he will only need minor adjustments to that. He offered me an hourly contract. Then he told me to wait for him to send me next morning few more better recorded audio files in order to improve the quality of the final delivery.  He never sent those files. Waiting for those files i didnt start working and i didnt charge him. Then today he sends me a message that he wants to close the contract because he suddenly checked his other proposals that he received and he wants to work with another freelancer. I said, no problem. Please end the contract and provide feedback. Instead, He canceled the contract. No money were exchanged.  I know this will impact my JSS negatively because of it.Then i go to his profile and i saw he hired 3 more freelancers for the same job, and i bet he will cancel the contracts of 2 of them the same way. In our private messages he apologized for this and  now wants to compensate me somehow. I have three questions1. Is there anything that can be done so that this cancelled contract will not hurt my score? 2. Can this client can be penalized in some way by upwork for starting multiple contracts on the same project then canceling them and just abusing the system? 3. Can i dispute the cancelling of the contract, if no money were exchanged and i didnt even had the chance to work and be judged for my work? It feels very unfair to have my JSS dropped because one client just plays with the system.

	Integrate hours to invoicing system?
","Oct 30, 2017  12:31:57 PM","
I have hired some Upwork freelancers to work on some support tickets I receive from clients. The tickets come through ZenDesk and I manage my projects and client invoices in Paymo. I'd like to export the hours logged by freelancers in Upwork into Paymo so that I can convert some of that time into invoice line items. Has anyone done an integration from Upwork hours reports to Paymo... or any other invoicing system (I'm thinking of changing to Freshbooks). I'd prefer this to be automated so that I don't have to manually transfer the hours. I looked at Zapier and they don't have any integrations with Upwork (or Odesk) at this time. Thanks

	How do you expect us to import transactions into our accounting software?
","Jul 8, 2019  06:37:28 AM","
The upwork exporting of transaction details are not formatted in a way that can be easily imported into any accounting software in any level of detail.  The custom transaction export is a mess of payments, escrow requests, fundings and releases.  It requires a substantial amount of manual review just to prepare to import.  We have to use different rules for the descriptons and types based on whether the contract is hourly or fixed price.  Overall the process has frustrated me enough to the point of avoiding using Upwork where possible.  And to be charging membership fees for account tiers without having a good system for this is pretty shocking, honestly. To upwork staff - try to use a sample export of 200+ transaction rows and sort them in to true expenses and payments. How do other clients handle importing to their accounting software? Do you all do it manually?

	Complaint: Upwork blocks communication beween clients and potential freelancers
","Jan 7, 2016  08:09:33 AM","
I used Elance in the past and never had any problems. With Upwork, not only is it not user friendly or intuitive, I have read nothing but negative reviews from other users on the net. So, with that in mind, I write this post to help Upwork improve.  On Elance, before choosing a freelancer, the client had the opportunity to communicate with freelancers who made proposals. This was key to the hiring process as it allowed the client to ask freelancers to clarify any proposals, provide more specific information, request more samples of work, etc. It also gave the freelancer the freedom to ask the client for any necessary clarifications, talk deadline flexibility, etc.  Unfortunately, Upwork has implemented a communication black-out and does not allow for this kind of communciation at all. Thus, Upwork has completely thwarted the hiring process. With Upwork, you cannot communicate with a freelancer until after you have proposed to hire that person AND he/she has accepted. But how do you know if you want to hire someone if you cannot communciate about the important details mentioned in the last paragraph above?  I thought Upwork's communication black out couldn't be true, so I contacted Upwork's help line yesterday and Mark Anthony confirmed that this is indeed the way the system is set up. He writes, ""'(05:07:08 PM) Mark Anthony:' It is by designed of our system that you will be able to get a chance to communicate to a freelancer who has a pending offer when he accepts the job offer you sent. I am sorry for the inconvenience this has caused you.""  This also causes another real problem and hits home to me right now. I offered to hire a freelancer 6 days ago, and he still has not responded. Tomorrow was the original deadline date I provided. I have worked with him before and so would have liked to have contacted him to see if something came up or what is going on. But I cannot. Upwork has blocked any client/freelancer communication.  Mark Anthony said that I should lodge my complaint on this forum. Upwork, please allow the client to conduct well-informed and educated hiring. Otherwise, there really is no point to using your system. I look forward to your response.

	Freelancer doesn't answer anymore in the middle of a project

Hi all, I engaged a freelancer from Austria to get some website development done. He worked quite good and always answered my messages within 1-2 days. A couple of weeks ago, he then ment, that he could finish the project within the following days. Since then, 3 weeks ago, he doesn't answer any of my messages or phone calls. I can't get my head around it. Why would he do this, just a few days before he was about to finish the project and finally get his payment? Right now I don't have any source code or anything else, that would at least reward my first milestone payment. I just got the login data to his test system. So what can I do now? The project got quite urgent now.

	Copyright of illustrations / right to be named as illustrator
","Jun 19, 2019  11:58:15 PM","
Dear Upwork Community, I worked with a freelancer on Upwork to illustrate my children's picture book. I am very happy with the result and we worked very well together. Now in the very end we have an argument about the copyright of the illustrations. The illustrator wants the copyright and a (c) for the illustrations in his name in the book. His motivation is that he wants to be named as the creator of the pictures, but not selling them on or parts of the royalties. I want all rights like deciding how the illustrations will be used, the royalties of the book, decision about any follow-on products etc. I don't mind naming him as the illustrator.  Now the question is if he is included with a (c) in the book as the holder of the copyright of the illustrations, what does that mean? Is that just his right of being named as the illustrator, or would that give him more rights like selling the illustration to someone else, claiming any royalties, etc.?  I understand that the standard Upwork contract transfers the copyright to me as the client, but I don't want too much of an argument with the freelancer given that we  worked really well together. If a (c) in his name just means that I have to name him as an illustator that would be fine for me. But if it means he has all the rights to the illustrations, I cannot include the (c) in his name. Can anyone explain how to best make sure that he has the right to be named, and I have all other rights to use the illustrations as I please? Thank you!

	I need to file a complaint with a programmer I hired.
","Sep 12, 2017  01:40:09 AM","
I need to file a compaint with a programmer I hired from a couple of weeks ago. There have been revisions from the original job post, and everytime there was one, he asked for extra money, which I complied to, because I am also a freelancer here and I know the amount of time that goes into revisions. I built a website that has specific needs, the job post was to add a date and time delivery to the CART page / section of the ecommerce site, which he did without trouble. Long story short, there was another enhancement, which I tried to bargain for and complied by paying him with added milestones (take note, he did not write this from scratch, he customized a plugin). There is supposed to be a 2-hour preparation time. Say, for example the customer has the time of 9am, the takeaway/delivery time at its earliest should be at 11am.  It worked for a time, and then it did not. Then, it did over the weekend, and today, I checked the LIVE site AND the TEST site, both are not working. I was supposed to pay him yesterday, and apologized that I would pay today instead, but I received a message from my client that it is not working that is why I asked him to look into it. We were having a decent conversation, and then he replied that he can't talk, and said ""bye for now"". I just want to check this website off my list, but he does not seem to cooperate. He even said that I ALWAYS threatened with a complaint. I only said it a few times since last week because, other times I said you can file a complaint against me if you want (because he wanted to close the contract without finishing the job when I was telling him that troubleshooting is part of creating/customizing a plugin and that he shouldn't get extra for doing that). I just want this solved. I am pretty sure I tried to be reasonable with him, but it is going to cost me USD100 already for customizations of a plugin he did not even create. I need him to check into this problem as to why the enhancement does not work from time to time, and he keeps saying that it has always worked on his side. I already sent him proof that it does not work on my side, but still he insists that I replicate the issue so he can fix it. How am I even going to do that? I am REALLY trying to be reasonable here. I need help.

Freelancer and I have both agreed that we are ready to pay the required $291 to take our case to third-party arbitration but Upwork has refrained from commenting or initiating the arbitration process despite our repeated requests to facilitate payment of the said arbitration fee.

						I have a go-to Freelancer who already knows my business processes. After several projects with them, Upwork suddenly decided to f up and display this error.I cannot rehire them, clicking this shows the error on the title.I can send them an invite but once they place their offer, clicking Hire shows the same error.I escalated this twice to upwork in the past week and my inquiry still doesn't have any response. All is alright on my account. The freelancer's account is also public. They haven't blocked me either...I can hire another freelancer though just not that 1 specific user. Is there anything I / she can do about it? Support hasn't been responding at all. Thank you.

	Can't read any messages
","Jul 20, 2015  03:52:18 AM","
Whenever I click the ""Messages"" link at the top of the page, I get an error message. I basically can't read any messages. However, if I directly type in this following URL, I can read my messages - this was the fix that UpWork tech support gave me... upwork.com/message-center/inbox/# That's not much of a solution and I wonder how long it will be effective for. Shouldn't the ""message"" link at teh top of the page work error-free? I'm opening an account at freelancer if this doesn't get fixed in a couple of days. This is such a waste of time. Has anyone else had this problem?

	Change to Paid Connects for Freelancer having negative consequences
","Jun 19, 2019  06:46:00 AM","
A couple of days ago, I posted a job - visible on Upwork only - to the job boards. And for the past few days, I've had a lot of freelancers try to reach out to me personally via email and phone to snag the job rather than submit a proposal through the job posting. I'm wondering whether anyone else has noticed an uptick in this behaviour, and whether we'll be seeing it a lot more now that freelancers have to pay for the priviledge of submitting proposals? If so, I'm not a fan. At all. In fact, I feel a little stalked when someone managed to track down my personal cell #.

	How do i file a complaint against a freelncer?

						I have a freelancer I have been trying to work with for at least 5 weeks. After failed attempts to get him to work on time, I decided to part ways. I asked him to upload my files, and I would pay out the contract. He told me that there was no need to pay him because the video I ‘gave’ him was payment enough. I did not give him my video. I shared it so he could learn from it. As I was cleaning up the folder, I noticed he did not upload all of my files from a previous video that I already paid for. No response. The original request was three weeks ago. He told me he did it 3 weeks ago. I specifically asked for one AE file because its a repeatable asset in other videos. He said it was there. I just got AE on my computer and opened all the files looking for it. Not there. I asked him for it again. No response. He believes he owns files i have paid for. He posted one on his profile without asking me. I just want my files so I can start new with another freelancer. And, i want him to destroy all copies of my work from his machine after giving me what I paid for. Are there any steps I can take besides leaving bad feedback?

Actually, I am not new to Upwork, but given my deficient computer skills, and lack of knowledge regarding basic functions on Upwork, I might as well say I am new. I will be VERY APPRECIATIVE if someone were to respond to these questions:: 1)  I want to send e mails to various freelancers.  But I find I only have the option of either inviting them to consider my project or hiring them for my project.   Where can I find a button or icon to click to send the freelancer a message. 2) I have a job posted on here.  If I recall corrrectly, it is entitled ""Web advisor and Guru""  (The use of the word Guru was intended to provide a little levity).  I have only gotten 1 response.  Please give me constructive criticism, tell me why my ad might dissuade people from applying, tell me if I make assertions which are off-putting or disturbing.  Please be honest and blunt -- but please refrain from gratuitous mockery or derision.    I thank you for your response

	General Messaging System Sorely Needed
","Jun 20, 2019  09:58:30 AM","
I work with several freelancer writers on Upwork, each with different experience suitable to different writing projects. It's often useful to have a chat with one of them about a prospective job to guage their interest and availability in a new job before I invite them or, if they determine they're not suitable or interested, to post it openly. It also helps to get their input on the job up-front to get their suggestions on the content. Unfortunately, Upwork provides no reasonable way to do that. Currently, the only way to send a message to anyone is by adding a message to a previous contract or starting the hiring process before knowing fully what the job will entail or if they're available. Both of these methods are very cumbersome and problematic. There's also a third option, which Upwork likely doesn't approve of and something the freelancers may not be comfortable with: getting their contact information and contacting them outside the system. Adding a message to an old contract makes no sense, even if you have one with the freelancer, since the message has nothing to do with that contract. Having to actually create a new contract just overly complicates things since the conversation with the freelancer is intended to determine their desire and availability and creates way too much overhead. Contact outside the system runs the risk of misunderstandings that aren't good for anybody. I know my freelancers' capabilities and have been impressed by their previous work. Upwork needs to provide a general messaging feature so I can more efficiently hire them for new projects or deermine ahead of time if they're available. You could even design it so the conversation could be attached to a new conract that stems from it if you want. This is a badly needed feature. And don't put it exclusively in a paid tier, either. Providing efficient ways to hire freelancers should be available to everyone.

	Freelancer demanding higher rating
","Jun 25, 2018  11:15:43 AM","
			
				
					
					
						I’m a freelancer and client on the platform, so I definitely “get” both sides. I recently ended a project that had dozens and dozens of writers. I took time to rate and review all writers — all were good though, of course, some were outstanding and some were good enough. I gave many writers five stars and many 4.8 (so all 5s plus one 4) and so on. No one got below mid-high 4s.Since the reviews have gone public, I’ve been inundated with DEMANDS from writers to change their scores to 5s. Many of these writers got 4.8 stars and thereabouts — great scores! I’m shocked and appalled they’d all demand five stars. After explaining that these are good scores and reflective of my experience, many are still demanding their scores be changed, harassing me online, etc — all over a fraction of a point.As a freelancer and a client I pay attention to reviews. If everyone gave everyone a five, the reviews would mean nothing. When you’re looking at many writers at the same time, it becomes apparent not everyone is the same quality-wise — I have the very best fives and (slightly) came down from there.Curious if anyone else has had this experience and, if so, how they handled. I reached out to Upwork and they basically said I need to report the writers — not something I want to do since getting them in trouble with the site feels very extreme.

I hire a contractor in 2017 to do a little work on my website.  I have not had any communication with him since 2017.

I immediately filed a dispute.  Upwork went ahead and paid him anyway. Upwork basically said they don't monitor the ""quality"" of the work.  He filed another fraudulent work diary this week.  I have reached out to Upwork many times about this.  I have done everything I am supposed to do by requesting a refund and filing disputes.  Upwork needs to protect me and refund my money from this con artist.  I need help!!

	The $29.99 Premium job posting is a waste of money
","Jun 17, 2019  05:34:39 AM","
I created a perfectly defined $300 job with clear requirements and very few qualifications for freelancer, a C++ programmer. And when posted, clicked to include the service of assistance ""to locate talents"", which costs $29.99. Here is in short what happened:

I received an obviously automatic chat message from **Edited for Community Guidelines** which included "" I'll start connecting you with top talent for your job""
I sent a profile of a freelancer as example of a good candidate
""sure thing, we will go through the job post and applicants and will keep you updated with what we find""
6 hours later from me: ""Ok, thank you. When can I expect any candidates from you?""
response: ""our SLA is 48 hours""
Nothing happened 50 hours after publishing the job, I found a freelancer via other source and closed the job
Immideately, the messages room brcame archived, so I didn't have a chance to ask the agent whether she did anything related to the promised service

What did I pay for? The dispute menu relates only to job payments, so how to dispute this payment? It's not a lot of money, but it gives a feeling of being tricked into giving money for nothing. And on top of that I had to spend time trying to figure out how to deal with that. And it seems that complaining here and warning others is the only option available

So good people  I hired a freelancer to help me on a specific project. She misconvied me into being an expert, and she asked for hourly billing, of which I was fool to accept (believing upwork will be there whenever I needed help)! After she took $410 over the course of three months, I discovered upon our discussion that she was literally joking around with no work at all produced. Whenever I asked for update ""I'm working on it"", until boom: I found she was even talking about different topic.  I disputed, she rejected the dispute, the meditation came. The mediation employee asked her three times for proof of work, she literally provided a figure of her sending google links to me! She then claimed to have worked on a code that she claimed that she made it from scratch. When she uploaded it, I posted back with the original source of that code, that this scammer didn't even change a letter from it (Yep, it was a letter-by-letter, copy and paste code, even on different topic!).  After all, the employee told me that she cannot rule out in favor or anyone as mediation is about reaching mutual agreement, and that she cannot force the freelancer to reufnd the money at any case! WHAAAT! She has proof of fool play and lies in front of her eyes. That freelancer never even replied back to her continues request for proof of work. Now I'm being charged $410 for literally nothing.  Please help. What should I do!

	Paid over 2300$ and didn't receive anything!
","Jun 11, 2019  01:51:00 AM","
Hello Upwork Community,
 
for my latest project I hired german freelance programmer **Edited for Community Guidelines**. Since I'm from germany myself I thought it would make sense to hire a fellow german. We negotiated and talked about the project (**Edited for Community Guidelines**) and ultimately came to an agreement and started an hour based contract.
 
Kristin started to work on the project almost daily which I could monitor in the work diary. She told me that she's currently in Africa ( visiting her boyfriend **Edited for Community Guidelines**who is also a game developer with a huge youtube channel **Edited for Community Guidelines** and was facing power breakdowns which led to me not hearing anything from her for days, which I wasn't too concerned about.
After a couple of weeks she had made progress with the project and I decided that it's time for her to commit some code to me and start a prototype test.
Then suddenly from one day to another she just wouldn't answer to my mails or messages on telegram. Nothing. After not getting any answer whatsoever I paused the contract. Since then I haven't heard a single word from her - however she remains very active on her youtube channel and twitter profile.
 
I requested to get my money paid back on upwork but nothing happened. If anyone has an idea of what I should do now please let me know.
 
Here are some of her public profiles:

Hey,
 
So I applied for a work and then the client responded to me and wanted to add me on skype. But he said his company's CTO will add me, so I said sure. But after giving my ID to him, someone add me right away and I felt a little suspicious. Later on that person was trying to tell that he will give me website job if I let him use my own upwork account and also said if I could provide him with a US upwork account. Well, I blocked the guy but I took all the screenshots of the conversation so that you guys can deal with it.Hope all these attachments helps, thank you!

Hi there,  Is there a way to ask Upwork staff to check with the freelancer with regards to the work I have assigned? I hired a freelancer to do product descriptions which he gladly accepted.

	Refund request for being unsatisfied with the work outcome
","Dec 19, 2017  08:43:15 AM","
I have worked with my freelancer for about a six months and the work was very slow. Now, I have ran out of my time to work on this project and my freelancer is handling this refund request very well because it was a fixed price job. So there is not guarantee of getting my money back unless he manually does it. I already paid all the requested money and he knows very well how this process works.  Payment which was $8000. $2000 for prototype build and $6000 for iPhone app development. I don't even want the full refund because I think it is unfair to make my freelancer work for nothing. I want to ask for my $6000 development fee. I called the Upwork and currently communicating with one of the Upwork customer experience team member but they are not even responding back. So they are not helping. The main reason why I want this refund is because the development was very slow and now I ran out of time because I have to leave the country in few weeks. Also, I am not satisfied with the quality of finishing touch. There was a lot of issues during the process of development and I had to point out every little details that are wrong and not working and it took long time for me to point ouf everything. And I don't have time to do that anymore. My final option is disputing $8000 with the bank as in reason of Good/service not as expected but Upwork remined me that disputing with my bank will suspend my account and I will have no longer access to my conversations which is a mouse trap. I am talking to my lawyers to find a way out of this but any advice/help from Upwork community will be great.

	Question with hiring for a Social Media Marketing Agency
","Jun 3, 2019  03:56:36 AM","
Hello, So as the title says, I want to hire freelancers at some point in the near future for my social media marketing agency. One of the biggest questions that I have is, is it possible/reasonable to hire, lets say, a social media manager to manage a business's social media for a month, or 2, or 3.  My goal, as a SMMA is to keep clients (for the agency) generally longer term, preferably 3 months to a year. I  want to speak with the business, say ""I think we can focus on these areas"" then deliver the information to a social media manager and have them do their job for a month or more. So, is this possible to fulfill with a contract? How would I go about that? I am totally new to this platform and hiring freelancers but I plan to work very well with them and treat them with respect to themselves and their work. Thank you!  Edit: One more thing! Money for ads. If a business gives me money to be spent on ads. How would I get get that money to a freelance to put towards ads?

I want to file a complaint against a free lancer that we have been working with on our project. He promised to write the code in PHP from scratch and instead used code igniter. He lied from the begining. Using code igniter is not coding from scratch. The organization of the files are terrible, even if I hired another developer will be almost impossible to correct or find/fix any issues. The quality of his work is poor. The site functionality is poor. It has been over a year and the website is still incomplete. He disaapeared for weeks at a time. We are having alot of issues with the site and he ended the contract. He would ignore messages and concerns. His communication is terrible. The project also went over budget and he demanded more money to correct his own mistakes and for items that were in the scope of work. We were his biggest $ project to date and he treated us horribly. He kept rushing us to pay each milestone even there were issues. He promised he would correct all issues and he did not . I want a full refund cause I have to do the site complete over because we are having way too many issues. If this freelancer does not refund me I will take other measures through my credit card company.His name:

	client tip: hire fast, don't interview
","Jun 1, 2019  07:38:14 PM","
I just finished working with yet another Upwork freelancer who helped with technical issues. Once again, this was an exceptional experience. Great work, by a genuine expert. He really helped me out. I have been consistently using the same type of hiring strategy when hiring freelancers to do highly technical work: - Post a brief description of the problem.- Block the section that asks the candidate to write a proposal- Add in my own custom question: ""Are you available to work now?"" Then I hire the first applicant, and make the job private so that other freelancers don't apply. I don't spend any time interviewing the candidate. I just click the ""Hire"" button. I have consistently had great results when doing this. I can post a job, get help, and then close the job within hours. Sometimes these are difficult technical problems to solve, but these freelancers have stuck with me and helped me solve them. I don't want to suggest this strategy is appropriate for all types of work, but this has been a very successful strategy when hiring people to do all kinds of server configuration work. I have saved a lot of time and money by not interviewing candidates, and by hiring freelancers quickly. If I hire a freelancer who turns out to not be helpful, I would be able to simply thank her for her time and close the contract.But from my experience, most of the freelancers willing to try to help with technical issues while doing screen-sharing are self-selective, so that only people who really know what they're doing actually apply to these jobs. I have done this so many times with such consistent success, I rarely even look at the candidates' profile pages. (This is NOT how I hire everybody. I do NOT hire writers or artists this way. I definitely look at portfolios when hiring for creative work. But I still skip ""intervewing"" freelancers.) I'm very appreciative of the amazing resource that Upwork is for hiring technology experts!

","Jun 1, 2019  01:34:33 AM","
Hi Adel,
 
If you are ending a fixed-price contract and there are remaining funds in escrow that are no longer required for the project, you can request an escrow refund. If you want to continue with the contract, but not release all of the escrowed funds, you can instead release a partial milestone payment. The leftover funds can then be used towards the next milestone. For instructions on how to request a refund for payments already released from escrow, click here.

I've looked at  a fair amount  of their TOS and lots of their other legalese and it seems to be focused on protecting Upwork's rights, etc.  Where is the info about my rights as a client? And if you say ""It's in their Terms of Service"", well where specifically? I've read a great deal of the TOS.

	Long Term Client Ready to Quit Upwork due to Frustration with Placeholder Bids
","May 16, 2019  05:08:09 AM","
It used to be that if we posted a request for bids for a fixed price contract that we would actually get fixed-price bids.  Now, virtually every vendor bids the exact amount as the fixed price that was offered as a placeholder bid and then asks to have a discussion to ""finalize"" the requirements.  In other words, they want to sell higher priced services on an hourly rate.   They demand to have a skype call.   Seems like Upwork is now a referral service - not a job bid board.    These fake bids are a waste of time and we won't be inviting anyone with a placeholder bid to our projects in the future.   I don't like the requirement to insert a bid amount- it basically means that vendors don't actually have to think about their actual bid.    Are there other websites besides Upwork that are more client-friendly?    Any thoughts on how to limit the number of fake bids?

","Mar 23, 2019  03:24:25 PM","
			
				
					
					
						I’m extremely annoyed right now.I hired a freelancer for a fixed rate job. Before hiring him i asked him 2 times to verify that he could do the work I requested and he did. I asked him if there was any additional information he needed to do the tasks. He said no.Fast forward: he submits his work. Which includes 2 of the 6 items that were supposed to be completed.I tell him that I still need the remaining 4 items. He resubmits, now with 3 items completed. I tell him AGAIN I still need the remaining 3 items. He sends me about 4 messages demanding payment immediately. I tell him again that the work is not finished and since there’s no milestones, I won’t approve escrow until the work is done. He then contacts up work to ask if I can release payment. The work still isn’t done (the list of things to be done is ITEMIZED, so there is absolutely no confusion). I message him again, asking him if he actually plans to finish the work or is he just going to keep demanding payment. He sends me a message that says “I feel like you’re just adding more things for me to do so you don’t have to pay me. Pay me now.” Like I said, this job was to provide 6 items that the government requires me to get for a land use application. The requirements are defined by law, there is nothing for me to “add.” I message him saying that I literally copied and pasted the initial job description and removed what he didn’t do. I guess he didn’t disagree with this and replied “ok well I feel like I’ve done 90% of the work so just pay me 90%” .I obviously have no problem paying the freelancer, the money is already spent and put in escrow. I’m just trying to figure out how I could issue a partial payment for the work completed. I don’t see the option to issue this payment. And clearly I would only do a 50% payment since he only completed half of the tasks I asked him to complete.

I just created a Milestone for the next phase of work on a project (after releasing funds for the first phase).  I didn't discuss the details of the next Milestone with the Freelancer up front because I assumed any Milestone would need to be mutually approved.  It appears, however, that the Milestone is set in stone once created. How can I cancel or edit the Milestone? In this case, both the Freelancer and the Client (me) are amenable to cancelling the Milestone and creating a new one.  I can appreciate the protection for either party cancelling a Milestone without the others approval, but I need a way to alter Milestones with mutual approval.

	Feature suggestion: Forum style marketplace for projects
","May 26, 2019  05:25:40 PM","
Often we don't have time to go through the hiring process but we are just looking for an answer to our problem. The StackExchange network is very useful in that regards since any user can post an answer which will be subject to scrutiny (and votes).  So it would be very interesting if we can take the advantages of the SE network and adapt them to Upwork.  In many cases a business is interested in a problem that can be stripped of private content and turned into an abstract problem. One could then post it to the SE network but because we are searching for quality answers fast, Upwork can play a great role here. Now suppose the problem is posed and the post receives multiple different answers. Who gets the fee promised? One suggestion is to leave it to the post creator to decide. They can give the fee to one answer or spread it among multiple interesting answers.  What if one user steals the public answer of some other user who already posted? In the SE network the time of posting an answer is recorded and so that can be helpful. But what if a user who already posted edits their answer based on some follow up answer? One suggestion here is to restrict editing access to an answer after a few minutes.  Feel free to move my post to any location that is more appropriate.

	SUGGESTION - FEEDBACK Clients profile should be mandatory

As a freelancer or a agency I MUST have a profile in wich I provide information about my activity , examples of my work, feedback from other clients, but also private information such as how much I earned so far.... If I am chatting with you by clicking in my picture you can see my profile with lot of relevant info.But when it comes to clients, they dont don't have the obligation to filla profile and thats simply wrongI've been working in upwork for several years and I clearly know there are a lot of super Crappy clients with no experience at all, and the freelancers should also have tools to evaluate and filter those clientsWhen clicking on a client's icon I should be able to know if this person really exists, what is the company website , how much they spent so far. see all the feedbacks they have ...etc etcBut none of that is possible . I have to deal with Ghost clients. people I dont even know if I can trust them or who they are or where they come from or what experience they have in the job they are supposed to be ""correcting""THis is a very unbalaced situation, the same way we can see freelancers profile. we should also be able to see clients profile and choose wheter we want to work with them or notNot beeing able to evaluate clients . will harm upwork in teh long termAm I the only one needing this?

	Terms of Use - Confidential Information & Work Product Authorship
","May 22, 2019  02:01:15 PM","
I'd like the community's view on this issue. I engaged with an Upwork Freelancer on a Fixed-Price Contract to design branding work for a third-party (my client). I needed to provide confidential information to the Freelancer, including the third-party’s name, their target market, and the growth plans for their brand. The Freelancer developed the concept for the brand design work. They shared it with me through Upwork, but simultaneously shared it publicly on multiple websites that host the Freelancer’s personal portfolio, where others viewed and commented upon it. Making matters worse, the Freelancer published my name, the name of our company, the name of the third-party, the third-party's growth plans, and the fact that I hired them to complete the project. The Freelancer admits to publishing this information, but believes its insignificant, especially since they’ve removed it upon my request (though the posts can still be found indexed and cached on other websites and search engines). This is a problem for several reasons. First, it's now publicly known that the company I work for has engaged a Freelancer to complete this project for the third-party. We can't claim the work as our own, which is what we thought we were buying. Second, the third-party company hadn’t planned the official market launch of their brand initiative for another 8 months. They won't be able to use this work product as it was released unofficially well before. Third, confidential information relating to their growth plans is now public, and can be seen by their competitors. I'm afraid of the consequences this will have on their business, and fear they'll hold me liable. When I signed up to Upwork, it was my understanding that Freelancers will protect the secrecy of the confidential information disclosed to them for the purposes of the contract. It was also my understanding that the work produced by the Freelancer would be my sole and exclusive property, and that I would be deemed the author. I wouldn’t have used Upwork otherwise. I'd imagine that now, since there was a material breach of contract, I'd be allowed to cancel the contract and have the funds in escrow returned to me. Afterall, no one can use the work the Freelancer has produced, plus I can’t continue to work with the freelancer given what’s happened. However, it seems that the only way I can have my funds returned to me is by paying $291 USD to an independent arbitrator. This is half the contract amount! Can anyone share their thoughts or similar experiences on this situation? I've looked through the Upwork Terms of Use and have found four sections that seem relevant, which I’ll include below. My interpretation is that the Freelancer wasn't allowed to make public the confidential information I was providing her. It also seems to suggest that the work I'm paying for will become mine and mine alone, so when the Freelancer publicly displayed it on other websites, it ceased to become mine. Further, when the Freelancer claimed authorship of the work on their portfolios, they ceased to be able to give me that authorship. I'm confused as to why I now need to spend hundreds of dollars for an independent arbitrator to come to this conclusion. I'm also upset because this Freelancer may have cost the third-party huge sums in damages. I’d imagine some company secrets could, if released to competitors, spell the end of that company’s future. In any case, I don’t understand why Upwork wouldn’t terminate the Freelancer’s account and return me the amount in Escrow for their actions. Am I mistaken? Any suggestions would be appreciated. For Reference - Upwork Policies 7.1 CONFIDENTIALITYTo the extent a Client or Freelancer provides Confidential Information to the other, the recipient will protect the secrecy of the discloser’s Confidential Information with the same degree of care as it uses to protect its own Confidential Information, but in no event with less than due care, and will: (a) not disclose or permit others to disclose another’s Confidential Information to anyone without first obtaining the express written consent of the owner of the Confidential Information; (b) not use or permit the use of another’s Confidential Information, except as necessary for the performance of Freelancer Services (including, without limitation, the storage or transmission of Confidential Information on or through the Site for use by Freelancer); and (c) limit access to another’s Confidential Information to its personnel who need to know such information for the performance of Freelancer Services. 7.3 PUBLICATIONWithout limiting Section 7 (Confidentiality), Client and Freelancer will not publish, or cause to be published, any other party’s Confidential Information or Work Product, except as may be necessary for performance of Freelancer Services for a Services Contract. 6.4 OWNERSHIP OF WORK PRODUCT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTYUpon Freelancer’s receipt of full payment from Client, the Work Product (except for any Background Technology), including without limitation all Intellectual Property Rights in the Work Product (except for any Background Technology), will be the sole and exclusive property of Client, and Client will be deemed to be the author thereof. If Freelancer has any Intellectual Property Rights to the Work Product that are not owned by Client upon Freelancer’s receipt of payment from Client, Freelancer hereby automatically irrevocably assigns to Client all right, title and interest worldwide in and to such Intellectual Property Rights. Except as set forth above, Freelancer retains no rights to use, and will not challenge the validity of Client’s ownership in, such Intellectual Property Rights. Freelancer hereby waives any moral rights, rights of paternity, integrity, disclosure and withdrawal or inalienable rights under applicable law in and to the Work Product. If payment is made only for partial delivery of Work Product, the assignment described herein applies only to the portion of Work Product delivered and paid for. TERMINATION OF A SERVICE CONTRACTUnder Fixed-Price Contracts, once a Client’s Payment Method has been charged to fund the escrow account for the Engagement, absent a full refund to Client by Freelancer, the Service Contract does not terminate until the Freelancer Services are completed. However, either Client or Freelancer has the right to terminate a Fixed-Price Contract at any time with the consent of the other party or in the event of a material breach. If a Fixed-Price Contract is terminated, Client does not have the right to recover any payments already released to Freelancer from the escrow account for the Engagement.

	when dispute happens, my experience
","Oct 30, 2018  04:30:45 PM","
Hi,  I ordered an app on upwork to a freelancer that didn't finish his job. It was supposed to last 2 months, 8 months after his job was still unfinished, and the app full of bugs. But you know what, Upwork won't take any responsibility in it. If you don't receive a product through paypal, amazon, or any other website on this planet, you are refunded. On upwork, they think different. Let's say they innovated! Not only you are not refunded, but you receive a miserable treatment, and you have to pay an arbitration. They will tell you that it's escrow US laws... Who knows. So basically, as a client, in case of hidden defects or late deliveries, on upwork you are just not protected at all.  Plus, when you contact dispute department, nobody will tell you how everything works, they will expect you to ask many questions, but the worst is that you won't be able to chat, or have a call with them, and they response time is... 2-3 days, then it becomes clear that upwork is very scared of its own clients. So if like me you need to finish a project asap, upwork won't care and they'll take as much time as they can.   As a good client (that I was), my disappointment is huge, this website is very well done, but upwork is just miserable when it comes about clients safety or disputes. In this situation their commission is absolutely unjustified, and I probably won't use upwork again.

	Declined Invitations
","Mar 12, 2016  06:44:08 AM","
Hello, For some time now every time an invited freelancer declines the invitation I just get a simple message saying that it was declined. As I am also a freelancer, I know that you have to provide a reason to decline the invitation and this would be very helpful for clients to know. Sometimes they are just busy and I'd like to know if it would be alright to contact them again in the future. Sometimes the budget is too low, and if I can't offer more then I know I can't contact them again, but if I can offer more if the freelancer is really experienced, I would like to still contact them and ask them for a quote or consider them in the future. Before they changed again the platform, I could at least go to the freelancers invitation (aftr following a series a steps) and find out what option they had chosen. But with the new platform this is impossible. I only get the message that the freelancer declined the interview. Marissa

I basically just ruined this guys chances of getting more work because I couldn't consciously give a good review.  I feel like the system should allow canceling a contract without putting someone on blast.

To release the payment I need to verify the payment method using my latest statement:My next statement only arrives at the end of the month, and I want to pay the Upworker immediately. How can I change my payment method from my credit card to my verified paypal account in this specific situation? ThanksSebastiaan

After spending US$42,000 and investing 2 years of my time  I stopped a contract because of ineptitude of the freelancerI left negative feedback to help protect other employers but now find the feedback is not showing with ""No Feedback given"" being displayedBefore starting the contract I was curiouse as to  why there were other employers that had spent around $40,000 or more all with ""No Feedback given""Given that my negative feedback has been blocked to protect the big income earning freelancer I find it not believable that the other employres would spend tens of thousands of dollars and give no feedback.If in fact the other high dollar value employers have their feedback bocked then I have been mislead by upwork and would not have employed the freelancer company in the first place  and then  lost all of my money. I note that only smaller jobs done by this freelancer, all with 5 star,  are showing Please explain why my feedback and that of the others is not being displayed. Contract ID15714488

	Freelancer asking for 5 star review
","Apr 28, 2019  03:53:11 PM","
I recently had the very rare experience of a job going poorly. At the end of the contract, when submitting final files, the freelancer twice asked directly for 5 star feedback. After the second time, I reported them to Upwork but it seems like nothing happened. We did not leave them 5 stars. They did not leave us a review at all (I think they knew they were going to get less than stellar feedback from us). After the 2 weeks had passed and our review was visible to them, they again messaged us directly and asked us to change their feedback to 5 stars. Now that they were directly asking for feedback to be changed, I thought surely that was a violation of Upwork terms. So I reported them again. This time I was told that unless they are either threatening me or extorting me, that is still not a violation of Upwork terms. Each request from the freelancer has been politely worded. There have been no threats or extortion. But I still feel very uncomfortable that this freelancer is asking for this.  Any suggestion on how to respond to the freelancer's message asking for their feedback to be changed? Or should we just ignore?

	Freelancer kicked from Upwork for mid contract for ""security reasons"" refunds & responsibilties?
","Apr 29, 2019  02:05:13 PM","
Hey all,So I had a freelancer working on a longer IT project. Some ~4 weeks in the upwork platform informs me that the contractor had ended the contract. I end up getting a message from my freelancer (off of the platform) that he had been banned, that upwork had taken his money, and that I should pay him off platform for the work that he had already done. Getting spooked I rotate all the server credentials and contact support. I find out that upwork had refunded me for the previous weeks work, and they say that he was removed from the platform for a security reason (but won’t elaborate).I am now being harassed by the freelancer that I owe him money, he is starting to issue threats and has attempted to log into my servers after this all started to unfold. My issue/questions here:-Anyone have a similar experience and have any suggestions on how to proceed here?-Since Upwork wont/can’t tell me what the details of his perma-ban are I'm a bit skittish as to if he left anything malicious on any of the hardware he has access to in the previous few weeks. In this case since I’m assuming Upworks TOS disclaims them from any liability what are my options for getting my previous 3 weeks back assuming I just trash everything he ever touched and roll back backups from before he had access to anything?

I feel like it might be a good idea to implement something like this. You could get additional connections for every contract you complete. It would provide greater incentive to submit proposals and reward busy workers. It would be more ethical AND more efficient at reducing spam than a paywall and overall it'd attract more users.

	Freelancer cheating with hourly contract
","Sep 15, 2017  03:39:25 PM","
That's not my first time in upwork.A good reputation (>4.8 stars rating) and >10K spent on the platform are good enough to prove that I'm a good client and upwork user. Nevertheless I've been cheated. Well it happens. No matter how hard you try to avoid scammers and cheaters.They always come. Nevertheless I'm really surprised of the basically no-action taken from upwork to protect the client. To make it short: I had an agreement with a freelancer for 1.000$.Deliverables where: 1) A full completed business plan2) An executive summary3) A pitch deck for those who don't know what these things are: basically when you're presenting your company or your product to an investor, you want to show them financial projection and market analysis (business plan), a super sammary of the project (executive summary), and a verbose/graphical presentation of 10 slides (pitch deck). Well, this freelancer insisted a lot to have an hourly rate contract rather than a fixed price to 'increase his worked hours' in the counter. Of course for the same amount.I wasn't super-happy. I hate not being able to verify and check what am about to buy before giving my money out.By the way this guy sold himself really well, looked professional, he has a decent reputation (87% success).I trusted him. Now, just to make a comparison, it's like if you're asking someone to you build a car.He needs to create the project first, work with some numbers, buy all the needed accessories and then, at the end, you'll have your deliverables: the car. What he did was tracking hours showing that he was doint market research here and there for the Business Plan. HOW IN THE WORK COULD I DISPUTE THESE HOURS ? Please UpWork, tell me HOW! :-) Well, when he reached 950$ charged in 2 and half weeks, he started to deliver one and half badly drafted page of the executive summary.Ok, I don't mind.I made a review, and sent back for amendments.The day after the freelancer closed the job for ""Other reasons"" and just vanished. I immediatly contacted upwork support telling the story. Out of the 3 pieces which are the deliverables (whose weights are something like: 70% Business Plan, 20% Executive Summary, 10% Pitch Deck) I had a draft-not reviewed and amended version of the Executive Summary. All the rest was entirely missing. I mean, it seems to me that it's my clear right to have ALL my money back, isn't it?Nevertheless I proposed upwork to leave him 100$ or so for the bad draft.He had to spend some time writing it so it seemed fair as a compromise. Guess what?I've been able to dispute just the last week hours (167$) but for all the rest UpWork said that I had to dispute that timesheets before it was too late...  Really?Are you kidding me? I paid for something that I don't have and the cheater is safe? On top of this I made a deep check on this freelancer feedbacks.Strangely, all the hourly contract ones have ""no feedback given""... I'm seriously tempted to escalate this issue to the upWork management team. Freelancers like this one and this kind of support is seriously compromising the entire platform. Best,Alex

He doesn't care that I'm going to hire somebody else to make the job and is blaming the website that it has a lot of images in it even though I showed him websites that looks very similar to my website and has speed above 90%. so i have try for mobile its not increasing more so please close this job and pay me
this is max that i can do for youThat what he keeps saying to me! I told him that I won't pay him so he told me that he has all my website links and data, and that he has a copy of them after I gave him an ftp access to a clone website, and he will use them for evil things and maybe evil things for my website, unless I pay him at least half of the price we agreed on! and now when I open the conversation between us I see that he has deleted a lot of the messages he sent to me. How can I handle this situation, and where can I report this freelancer?

	Transaction history, how it work

Could anybody explain to me what's going on with my transcation history:
**Edited for Community Guidelines**
 
I pay 50$ for my project. Than I send offer to one guy, but he decline offer. Why transaction history display for me 100$ instead of 50$? I check my bank card, and I can see that I pay only 50.
 
Also, if he decline offer, how long it will take to get my money back? 
 
Will this money returned to my bank account, or it will be returned to upwork account?
 
If it will be returned to bank account, I can send new offer (and pay additional 50$). Otherwise I prefer to wait while system will return money to my upwork account. If it will be returned to upwork account, where I can see it, how I can force it (if it possible), and how I can charge this money for new offer?

	Talent Cloud Work Doesn't Count in ""regular"" Upwork?
","Apr 16, 2019  02:25:38 PM","
I'm not sure if this is the right place to address this concern but I have gotten work on Upwork through a Talent Cloud and my earnings are reflected on my Upwork profile. I have a great rating from them as well. Currently, this is the ONLY work I have gotten on Upwork and I'm hoping to change that. Unfortunately, to other potential clients, it looks like I don't have a score and I haven't worked any hours. If they can see that I've earned money, why can't they see anything else? I'm missing out on potential opportunities because I appear to not meet all requirements if someone is looking for a certain score or hours minimum. Is there any way to change this?

	Upwork is killing my PC
","Mar 22, 2018  06:09:45 AM","
Every time I use Upwork to hire someone, my computer starts to freeze and I end up restarting it. Up until today, I always thought that was a coincidence, but then as I was hiring today my computer slowed down a lot and I suspected something is just wrong, and when I tried to analyze it I figured out that Upwork is sucking a lot of memory, CPU and even GPU resources.   Please do not ask me to try with a different browser. Chrome is my browser of choice and I never had any problem with it in the past 5 years, except with Upwork.  I checked the inspector and figured out that just one page on Upwork had 375 requests to scripts and resources, each accompanied with their own latency and processing time. This is a LOT of resources considering I previewed just 4 profiles on that page through my job post. Here's a sample screenshot for your reference:  It seems to me that the problem is occurring because of the recent functionalities that Upwork introduced in past months about previewing someone's profile inside of the job post itself and hiring from there, instead of launching a separate tab with the profile's details. This move is affecting the user experience a lot. Well, I do like the added features, but what use is it when it's sucking up my computer resources? Can you please do something? I'm afraid this is going to be a LONG time to fix, but I hope Upwork is aware of the terrible situation, and you guys are probably losing a lot of sales, only because not so many clients are patient enough to wait, understand what's going on, have the knowledge to analyze or even come here to post about their problem. Thanks a lot.Best regards,Wassim

	Why am I forced to give feedback?
","Oct 11, 2015  03:11:23 AM","
I recently hired a person for a short test job, I emphasize this was only a test job.It doesn't reflect on any of the persons skills. At the end of the test project I decided not to continue the contract, but quickly realized that I'm forced to give feedback to the person. My question is why am I forced, to give feedback when obviously I don't have enough information to judge the persons skill? My goal, when pressing the button ""End Contract"", is to close the contract. What I don't understand is why am I getting blocked from the action I want to perform? Actually makes me think about the quality of ranking within the site since, if people are forced to give feedback. Bill just give any feedback, just to pass this stage. Think if this was a real situation in life, of me leaving a store and the security guard stops and tells me that I can't leave the store until I fill out a feedback form, since the company really needs it for the next client that comes in. I'll be happy for a logical response, to this strange treatment of clients

I have just recruited someone on Upwork to complete a few different websites for me. It is on an hourly basis, so I pay weekly. I am looking if there is a way to pay upfront to Upwork and add balance to my account (so that the money is within the account). The reason I am asking this is for accounting purposes; one project is worth $500 for example, and another contract is worth $750 for example. I want to pay Upwork in two instalments; $500 and $750 for the two contracts I have. This is easy for accounting purposes. At the moment though, Upwork charges me per week, which could be $250 in week one, $400 in week two, $300 in week three etc. How can I apply these costs to the individual projects. The way I'm suggesting is better for the freelancer as I'll always have money in the account i.e. my account balance is topped up. Is there this option?

	How to choose a graphic designer from a search rather than posting a job?
","Apr 5, 2019  08:17:31 AM","
I am relatively new to Upwork but have a profile set from years ago as a job seeker. I would like to now hire a graphic designer for a few projects and see where we can take my ideas. From what I understand (There is no phone number for customer support), I have to also create a ""Client"" profile to actually hire anyone for a job. I am not a company and I don't want to post the job and go through an interview process and hope I get the right designer. All I want to do is search for the right designer based on their cost per hour and contact them to see if it is something we can work on. I searched for this and found a designer who's profile really spoke to me but there is no hire option. Do I really have to write up a deteiled job description that includes type of designer I'm looking for, deliverable and all these terms just to contact and hire the designer I already want to hire based on reviews?

	Can Upwork finally fix milestones?
","Apr 3, 2019  10:19:07 AM","
The Upwork site staff have to start listening to what we want and need from the site. There are three big issues that particularly impact the client-side functionality of the site that frankly shouldn't be problems we have to deal with. The three things I am going to bring up are issues that have been brought up by Clients dozens of times over the years, things that I think we can all agree on as being problematic and user-unfriendly.  1 - Milestone funding  You can either fund the whole project, or fund one milestone at a time. Nothing in between. This is a ridiculous and pointless drawback. This isn't a function of the site, this is simply incompetent design. We have asked Upwork for years for the freedom to fund Milestones at our discretion. There's no reason why I shouldn't be allowed to click on a future milestone and fund it in advance without pre-emptively funding the whole project. I have a project where my freelancer submits multiple milestones at a time, sometimes out of order, which doesn't matter to me. But now I have to be restrictive with them and force them to submit one at a time simply because Upwork's infrastructure doesn't support this feature. 2 - Milestone Ordering Being unable to alter the order of milestones, especially for projects that can be fluid (like projects in the arts, design, and writing fields), is a huge oversight. I am personally running into this issue now, where due to circumstances, it's important for me to change the order in which the work is to be completed. But since I can't do that, I'm in a bind. 3 - App issues  I find that the app simply doesn't have enough functionality to really be useful. I can create job posts with it, browse applicants, or respond to messages. But I can't review work or approve milestones. I and many others want more from the app. In general, I feel like Upwork's infrastructure is not efficiently designed to support clients who work with the arts, writing, or design. Those of us who have more fluidity with our plans need these changes made to the site.

I cannot pay for an urgent contract because upwork hasn't sent the transactions to the card yet.

","Apr 2, 2019  01:07:15 AM","
Hello, Nice Coummunity Members!
 
I have lost my loyal developer, ""**Edited for Community Guidelines**"" who I used on different projects before.
He is very professsional and reliable developer.
But I can't use him again because his account has been suspended.
He informed me this and required me to contact you instead of him because he could't contact you directly. He is saying he didn't receive an email which he can upload some documents to do additional verification. I don't know what his saying means, but hope to help him so that I could use him continusouly on upcoming projects.
That's why I am contacting you. Could you kindly give him a chance to work on this platform again?
His account url is, ""**Edited for Community Guidelines**"".
Please let me know about this situation correctly.
 
Thanks,

The payment was then automatically made to the freelancer however when we checked what he had delivered the work was not done. We asked for a refund and stated that we would happily pay once he has completed the jobs and rectified his errors. We have no heard back from him and are not sure what to do and how to get out money back. I have tried to contact support but keep just getting a chat bot. What can we do?

	Refund a project when a freelancer did not meet the deadline and has been unproductive
","Mar 28, 2019  08:33:06 PM","
Hi, How do we refund hours paid (full refund) when a freelancer has been unproductive from the very beginning, the 2 weeks deadline was not met, has logged full hours but was seen with bad or unproductive results. As we have been monitoring his progress for the past 2 weeks we have seen minimal code push, project not even 25% done after 2 weeks and has not been communicating for several days. After the 4th call out we have decided to cancel and request for a refund. Refund was made the friday after the last invoice (Monday) Questions:1. After requesting refund for all invoices, should we close the contract?2. Can we refund all of the invoices? 2 in total.3. If he disputes how can we send evidences if ever required to show that he has not worked properly?

	Cannot find prior freelancer search results
","Mar 27, 2019  04:54:10 PM","
Is the Upwork search functionality still as quirky as forums from 2015 indicate it was? I'm new here and spent some time poking around last week to see if this might be a worthwhile resource for finding freelancers. I grabbed screen captures of intros for a few people that intrigued me (did not have an account, could not save profiles). This week, I'm trying to find those same people (and using the same and/or variations on the same keywords) and they don't appear to exist. I've even tried doing new searches specifically targeting somewhat unique words in their profile; no luck. I've tried a title search on their title; no luck. Is it really possible that multiple people I identified just last week are deleted, private, gone, something? Or is the search functionality not finding people? How do I search for specific people if all I know is their posted name?

	Why is the freelancer's address missing from the invoice?
","Dec 20, 2018  03:15:20 AM","
I don't understand why is it optional to freelancers to enter their full address, and to display it on invoices? Can't it cause misclassification risks? Upwork even wrote an article about it: https://www.upwork.com/hiring/trends/misclassification-3-mitigation-tips/ So my problem is that I am a registered business in the EU (with valid EU vat number), so I pay freelancers using my business PayPal account, so I need a valid invoice from the freelancer. But how could be a valid invoice which doesn't even contain the issuer's full address, just a name? Then how can I prove to local tax authorities that I hired a freelancer outside the EU, and not a local employee from my home country? Because if I pay money to a freelancer who is located in my country, and he/she is not a registered sole trader, then it is not client-freelancer relationship anymore, but it is called employment, and there are other additional taxes to be paid like social security tax. So by default not even the freelancer's country is displayed on the invoice. There are also VAT problems here: If I hire some locally and he/she is a registered sole trader, then local VAT is payable.But if not even the freelancer's country is display on the invoice, then I don't even know the country of residence of my freelancer. So before hiring there is this unnecessary conversation when I have to explain them why I need their address on the invoice. But why make it optional? I think it is ridicoulus that you don't display the full freelancer's address on the invoices by default, please make it mandatory. I guess it could be a problem even in the US. Let's say a US business client hires a freelancers from the Philippines, and the final invoice only containt the name of the freelancer, then how can this US business prove that they hired a freelancer from the Philippines, and not a local employee from the same US state where the business is registered in?

	Wordpress developer stole my website files
","Dec 1, 2016  01:57:21 PM","
I hired **Edited for Community Guidelines**  to update my wordpress site. I did not give him FTP access because I have had bad experience before. So, what he did is he uploaded the ""file manager pro"" plugin and he made a back up of my website files which included previous backups done by me through c-panel and then after for no reason he cancelled the contract so that I would not give me the bad review that he stole my website files. I already put a fraud claim on upwork. What are my other options regarding this? I am at a huge loss because I cannot use that site and he most likely will use my website files to use my site for his own use. So, what are my options here on upwork.com regarding fraud?
 
Thanks for any information provided. Freelancers should not be allowed to cancel contracts. I think this would prevent fraud since they would be concerned that if they commit fraud everyone would know about it when the client posts the review. I have attached a screenshot where he admits he made a backup of my site without my permission.

	BYOF
","Mar 18, 2019  12:13:58 AM","
Hi, I got a freelancer to Upwork via BYOF (Bring your own freelancer). Upwork deducted the money from my account, the work also started. However, the freelancer says her profile is still unapproved. How can we solve this? Her profile is 100% complete, I know she's genuine. The reason I wanted Upwork was to have more designers and have everyone on the same platform. I've asked her to contact the forum, but she doesn't have the access to post any questions. Please help.

	Add a milestone BEFORE another milestone - is that possible?

Is it possible to add a milestone before another milestone? Something changed in the project so I would like to add another milestone before the next milestone as they need to happen one after the other. I cannot approve the last milestone and add another as the last milestone will have to happen at the end of the project. What  want is add one BEFORE the last originally agreed milestone. Thanks

I can see a freelancer's overall star rating for me on their feedback on a job, but is there a way to see how they rated each individual aspect of working with me? Clicking on the job title on their profile shows their individual stars, but not mine:  On the contract page I can see their star rating and text feedback but again, can't see a star break-down. I've never had to look at this before, but this is the first time I received less than 5 stars, and I'd like to know if there was something specific the freelancer felt like I had done wrong, so I can reflect on that and see if there's something I can improve next time. (I know I *could* just ask the freelancer, but I'd prefer not to do that unless I have to - I feel like it might come off wrong and be intimidating, and it might sound like I want them to change it (which I don't).)

But it does not include the freelancer's name, the milestone, or the the project name. So when I do my credit card accounting (Expensify) I need to log into Upwork and search by amount and date and then click through several items for every single charge to discover what project that charge applied to. It makes using UpW such a hassle! Am I the only person who wishes that information could be included in the confirmation email??  If this request resonates, please comment or request it so they can add the feature.

	Upwork Hourly Contract Scam
","Mar 10, 2019  04:36:35 AM","
Hello
 
I want to ask everyone here, have anyone here (other clients) have ever been deceived by any freelancer with hourly over charging activity?. Even upwork's them self admitted that they found our hired freelancer's used a malicious software to deliberately over charging ?
 
**Edited for Community Guidelines**
 
I felt this more than once, however; upwork always says that they can't refund for bad quality or finished work (but overcharged).  Since I already screenshot their confession.  This is so bad, so i'm going to try to contact a californian lawyer and considering to take a legal action because I asume we've lost much more money than the previous issue since we've spent more than $30K or more in this platform over the past few years. Unless they did something; such as trace back the hourly charged on our account; recheck all the hourly charged for malicious softwares activities; proof that not a singgle one of them was cheated; if they found cheated ones; they should send a paypal payment's request for refund to the given freelancers.
 
Sincerely

						Hi guys.This is my first time hiring a freelancer in upwork.Recently we hired a visual designer to do some logos for us. He was proffessional and met deadlines on time. Now we are on a fixed proposal. He has not reached the 1st milestone in which agreed milestone was that we choose an identity logo he produces for us. The thing is we have gone through 3 rounds and we notice on the first round he has used the same logos and or has taken components from other logo and put it together. He did admit that one of the logos he produced was actually used for a company already. After the 3rd round it seemed like we were giving more instructions to him rather then him finding the design. We were not happy with his work as there seemed to be no thought behind it. We messaged him in our intention of not further perusing his services.He now wants to be paid in full for the first milestone. But for comming up with already used designs and very uninspiring ones we feel like it's not fair for us to give him the 1st milestone, which is half the total amount.Need advice do we have the right not to pay since the first milestone agreed is us choosing one of his design?Thank you

	Hourly Freelancer not working on project - only 5-10% left
","Mar 5, 2019  03:57:01 PM","
I hired a freelancer to redevelop a small application - estimated to be about 35-45 hours worth of work.He committed to working on it at least 4hrs per day the first week, not more than that due to other work obligations he had.  But he would do even more for the second week, and in any event would finish by the end of that second week.  This freelancer had just finished a two year contract worth well over $100k with a glowing 5 star review. I felt that I was in good hands.  In the first few days of the project, I was becoming concerned because he didn't work on it for 2 days in the middle of the week.  I floated the idea if he was too busy, I understand, and would be willing to find someone else.  He was apologetic, and assuredly told me that he'd make up that time over the weekend, and for the second week, he was able to commit to 8 hrs. per day.   He actually ended up putting in just over 30 hours that first week (about 20 between Friday and Sunday).   Monday of the second week he logged 6.5 hours (making it us to 36+ hours).   We spoke that day, he was going to give me a version for testing with the rest of our stack the following day.  When I reached out to him the next day for the version to test, he was unresponsive.  Since then, 9 days later, he has put in just 4 hours.  I eventually heard back from him, he mentioned something about a personal emergency but assured me that he would be able to pick it back up, and we'd certainly finish before the deadline.    Since then, communication has continuted to be very spotty.  We're 40 hours into the project.  There are 2 minor tasks left, and one other task that is potentially more complicated. The two minor tasks should take no more than 2-3 hours to do total.  He originally told me that the last (more complex one) should take no more than 4 hours.  Each day he tells me he will work on the project soon, but generally he doesn't.   I imagine that he'll finish it at some point, but it's holding up other development, and I can't afford for this to go on for another 2-3 weeks.   I was in general too trusting, and clearly entrusted too much responsibility to him at the onset.  I've learned my lesson and will approach future engagements much differently. I promise!    He has Top Rated status, so I presume since early in week 2, when the work stalled, he's planned on just deleting any rating/feedback that I leave.  That has me at least thinking that I'm entirely at his mercy.   Getting someone else to finish up the project is of course a possibility, I'd definitely prefer to avoid that though given how close it is too finishing.  This has been somewhat of a nightmare - my goal is just to finish this up.  Aside from ending the contract right now, what would you guys suggest doing?

	How do I Ban a Freelancer

Hi upwork community, Me and my team been working on a project for 3 months (onsite project) and we need someone to do the HTML/CSS layout since we are too busy, and so for the first time I have hired a freelancer through upwork. I have a strict deadline to meet which is 2 weeks, and this freelancer promises to finish in one week but still I gave him 2 weeks of time, but then he asked for an additional 1 week regarding with his graduation at the university and so I gave an additional time of 1 week (3 weeks in total). Days after I hired him, I realized that he also accepted work from other clients and put aside of my work, so repeatedly I ask him to show the progress of my job, he said he will finish the job before the deadline. But till now even after the deadline comes this person has not given me any progress, not even reply my message. This is very detrimental to me because I need this job finished on time, all of my team has finished their job except this freelancer, I can't do anything in front of my client but asking for more weeks to finish, this freelancer just ruined my reputation that I have built for years, this is my first time I made my client dissappointed. Is there a way I can ban him from upwork ?

	Scam by Mobile App Developer
","Aug 4, 2016  07:55:05 AM","
For those people who are thinking of starting an hourly contract, don't bother to do so! If someone only wants to work with you on a hourly basis, please reject or work by fixed job basis.
 
I had a very very tough time trying to get back my money and I am still trying to fight for it. And don't think that by filing a dispute, Upwork is going to refund you the money. His name is **Edited for Community Guidelines** and I believe that is not his real name.
 
Once the freelancer withdraws it, that's it. You have to deal with the loss if the money is landed in his account.
 
Initially, I thought that he wishes to clock his hours so I went ahead with his demands and go for the hourly contract and not go for the fixed price contract. I wanted to help him to clock his hours so that I am able to get the app in return.
 
because the app is complicated so I am willing to invest some money to get things going but who knows that it's a scam.
 
I paid over $8000 for a mobile app because the freelancer said he need money to pay for his team, so I didn't think so much but he kept on giving me a few different lame bull**bleep** reasons which I can't believe that I actually trusted him for that. And I started to realize that something is wrong so I filed a dispute.
 
And if you think by filing a dispute, you can get back the money, then I am sorry to say that, if the freelancer withdraws the money, then you can almost say goodbye to your hard earned money and Upwork is not going to help to refund even though the freelancer didn't deliver anything.
 
I believe that the freelancer I worked with is very familiar with the policy probably because he have scammed a few clients and I am one of them. And you can't file a dispute after the next week once you have clocked the hours because Upwork will assume that you paid for the work even though they might just clock and not deliver anything.
 
So please be careful guys. I have lost about $8,000 plus and paypal can't reverse the transactions because Upwork used that policy against me. Best is to go for fixed price contract and only RELEASE the money if they deliver something. If not just file a dispute. I learnt the lesson the hard way and right now, I am still trying to figure out ways on how to get back my money.
 
Upwork is not going to help you even if you filed a dispute!

I now don't want to release the funds to him as it still says I have double the amount in escrow. Can't seem to find a viable solution to contact anybody regarding this - surely it should just be the click of a button? Thanks in advance,Josh

	Freelancer borrows money. Is it real
","Mar 4, 2019  06:50:37 PM","
Hi All, I hired a freelancer in Philippines to work on a website. Today, she sent me an urgent request to borrow $250, because her daugher needs to go to hospibal. If that is real, I don't mind helping her. But since we just starting working for 2 weeks, I am not sure whether her account gets hacked. Anybody gets similar experience? Her upworks rating is pretty good. I can post a negative review if it is a scam. Just don't know what to do. Thanks,

	Post a Job Wizard awkwardness
","Mar 4, 2019  08:06:36 PM","
I should start by saying I liked watching Upwork grow over the years, and the UX has definitely come a long way. I just want to mention a few things that seem awkward to me. Perhaps I am missing something; otherwise consider this some friendly criticism: When posting a job, on step 1 of the Post a Job Wizard, we are asked ""Enter the name of your job post"". Ok, WHY is this a multi-line text box? This is just wrong. Are you noticing what is happening? People are typing their entire job description into this box, thinking that you are asking them to describe their job. This is a basic UX blunder. You're presenting us with a multi-line text box when all you really want is a one-line job description. I beg you to fix this. It probably causes no issues and for all I know, it irritates no one but me but I can't help but cringe every time I see it. Next issue (a lot less irritating): On step 4 of the Post a Job Wizard, we are asked ""Which of the following best describes your project?"". I am presented with a short list of radio button choices. 9 times out of 10 NONE of the choices you suggest are correct. 9 times out of 10 I have to click ""Other"" and then type somethng in. I'd rather you give me a more complete list than make me type something in. Consistently prompting users to manually enter something that you would probably want to capture as some sort of metric smells like trouble. Imagine all the possible things we could type into this box - the variations, the typos, the nonsense text. OK and final issue ... I think on that same page there is a section labeled ""Screening Questions"". I can select ""Select from suggested or previous"". When I select that, I can see a looooooong list of my previous questions. The reason this list is so long is because so many of them are duplicated. One of my questions appears in the list 9 times. Actually, 12 times but 9 of those 12 are typed exactly the same and so I see no reason why you couldn't just dedupe this list before displaying it. Actually, I already know there would be some considerable effort into doing this on the back end, but it sure would make for a nicer experience. But hey - if I had to beg you to fix one thing, it would be the blunder on step 1.

	6 things to be careful about from our experience as a client if hiring low budget level developers
","Mar 1, 2019  02:42:23 PM","
EDIT: My experience is from low budget level software developers freelancers. Approx $10/hour. I agree this does not apply to all the budget levels and all the domains.This also applies to providing fulltime workload to a freelancer. We get usually 40-50 applications per job post. And the price is very important for us as that is where we make a profit. I just want to share our experience as a client.1. Timezone - you can check the timezone of the worker and compare it with what he is saying/- happened to us that freelancer was saying he is in Vienna but his clock showed +5 timezone2. The camera always on. When there is no camera, do not make any deal. Never. - Always when there is a camera problem this is a NO to make the deal. Always check the workers visual and his nonverbal communication.EDIT: Always on during the video calls. NOT always on during the remote work  3. Do not allow the second job to be opened at the same time.- You want to have the worker to work only for you. Make sure he closes all the jobs. It could be that the one which is not closed is not closed because of some issues.- Also, a freelancer could be working the second job at the same time or on the same day. As he is supposed to work for you, you would like to get his fresh hours, not the second job type of hours.EDIT: We provide fulltime workload and in our case, it is expected to have only one job. The situation what happened to us is that freelancer had two 8 hours jobs opened even though we have told him our condition.4. Always set the auto-tracker on.- Freelancers try to make excuses during the job that the auto-tracker is broken. Do not believe them. They lie. Cancel the job.5. Check the hours regularly and ask them questions about the details of the work. Have regular video calls with them. Try to understand the work and try to have detailed questions.- It can happen that the work is not done by them.6. Make a good test before they start.-  Sometimes freelancer gets help from some other people and he is not the one actually doing the job or having the right skills to do the job.Trust your gut feeling, compare the work and behavior of the freelancer with some of your colleagues. How do they behave? If you smell a scammer, it is a scammer  Stay on the safe side. Good luck Did you also experience similar problems? Leave me a comment.

	Unfair actions of my client. Need help in solving the problem!
","Mar 1, 2019  06:47:12 AM","
Hello! I've a terrible confusion with one of my client.   The task was about creating artwork for tattoo purposes. We've agreed with all the specifications & put them into the description of work. Client approved it.We set 3 milestones: 1) Analysis & References = I've completed it + approve with client & he get me paid.2) Sketch/Line = I've completed series of concept sketches for him & he has chosen the appropriate one. After this, I've created the detailed sketch & he has approved it. But he didn't get me paid for it anyway.3) Color/Final = It is my fault, but I proceed doing the job relates to 3-rd milestone & sent the client almost the final one version of the work (80-90% completed). He said me ""Ok, thanks"". I've noted him to get me paid with at least the 2-nd milestone (Sketch/Line stage, which was approved earlier). But he said he wants to show the final result first. I told him, that I can't share the final result without payment of 2-nd milestone.  Then, he just ended the contract without any comments (he hasn't asked me for edits or change the direction) & said me about poor quality of my services. Now he asked for refund of the 2-nd milestone. I consider his actions as unfair & maybe cheating (he can use almost finished artwork).        So, I want to get the payment for the job of the 2-nd milestone, which is in escrow.     Moreover, I'm worried about the possibility of bad feedback from the client side. It can affect my JSS.  I hope anyone can give me an advice what to do in this situation. Thanks!

	Hired freelancer to migrate Weebly to Squarespace. Didn't complete the project & wants the money.
","Feb 26, 2019  07:24:53 AM","
I hired a freelancer to migrate my website from Weebly to Squarespace. I provided him with an entire Google Folder with sub-folders marked by content, access to Weebly, and paid for a Squarespace domain the same day he was hired. He communicated with me that day, but then he kept saying 'they were working hard on it' every time I asked if he needed help or if we could talk about the project. But, there was nothing being done on the Squarespace site I had paid for since I would log in multiple times a day to check progress. 
 
I have a text from him the day before the full site was due saying he would deliver us the first iteration -- I checked Squarespace, and he had created a new squarespace template using 'Impact' instead of using the one I had already paid for, 'Mentor', and been working on. Not only that, he had old content. I asked him again to please communicate with me so we could get things done right. I didn't get anything the whole day nor did he communicate with me after that until at night, when I reached out to him asking him where the first iteration was. He said he was working on it for the next three hours and would have everything ready. This was my time 12 am at night. He promised to have something to me by my morning. I logged in the morning of, and still nothing that remotely reflects our Weebly site. He asked me that morning if he could have an extension until Monday, but I couldn't allow for that since I needed an up and running Squarespace site that day. He then changed a few colors around to reflect our colors and considered the project complete, with the pages already developed by the Squarespace template 'Impact', and having inserted old content he found somewhere instead of using anything in the Google Drive folders shared with him. 
 
I have everything logged, communication, screenshots of the G-Drive, his site that wasn't the one I paid for -- this guy clearly does not know how to use Squarespace nor was he professional. 
 
I paid him $25 for his slipshod job. Now, Upwork is telling me to pay him more for something I cannot use or go into arbitration and have to mandatorily pay even more. How is this fair? What can I do? I provided 24 pages of proof with text logs, upwork chats, screenshots of weebly pages and what he created (nothing since he just used the Squarespace Impact template, changed some colors around -and added a few of our pictures - which I could have done). I am more than willing to screenshare with them the weebly site, his upwork site (Impact template), and the Google Drive folders and content so they know what was actually expected and what was done. But, I'm not getting a response to do that. 
 
It is my fault for hiring someone who was sly and jumped on the phone to talk about details instead of sending a clear outline through upwork. But, this is my first hire and I'm not sure I would use upwork again simply because of the way the support is treating a client that has shown a great deal of proof that the work being paid for was not conducted. 
 
Recommendations?

	Tips for freelancers! Do your research, know your limits and areas of expertise.
","Feb 22, 2019  09:36:53 AM","
Hi all, I've been a freelancer on Upwork previously and now I'm more of a client hiring other freelancers. Freelancers are the best of the best. They are proactive, skilled and highly motivated.  On a recent project, I hired two freelancers. They wrote excellent proposals but their deliveries were mediocre at best. I've now learned to look for specifically skilled specialist instead of general knowledge or industry knowledge-based freelancers.  The one thing the freelancers didn't do was research!!! As an example, one freelancer mentioned training employees in their project delivery. I don't train or work with employees! They didn't research my industry, my business, and clients. I provided my website and a slide deck but they didn't bother to understand my business. You can not do branding or marketing for a client if you DO NOT understand their profession, industry or business. You will deliver subpar work. My tips for you is to make sure you go above and beyond and try to really understand your client's business, their pain points and ask questions! Know your areas of expertise and niche where you offer the most value. If you took one class on YouTube, you are not a Facebook Ads expert.  This post speaks to only a few because I know there are so many excellent freelancers on Upwork.

	Freelancer does not want to do the job till the end
","Feb 23, 2019  11:42:00 PM","
Hello all of Upwork community.
I have one question for you. 
Basically I posted a job like a month ago and agreed to hire one freelancer. Now the problem is that he does not want to do everything which was written in the offer / contract. He is saying that work needed to be done was not written in the job description - Which is true. Job description was posted for public that freelancers can apply on it. But later after we talked a bit about the project I made an offer where I clearly stated what work needs to be done. Please take a look at the screenshoot in attachments. And he agreed and accepted the offer which is contract with client and freelancer at the end and this should count if I understand everything correctly, right? - not job initial description.
As you can see I wrote that he would need to send video of working prototype and then sending it to my home with tracking number. He does not want to do this part. And I also wrote that all the work needs to be done for him to get paid. Also during the project we had conversation he told me 2 times that he will send video and also physical prototype to my home...
 
So I am asking you what should I do. He opened dispute and claiming that he did his work eventhough he did not. He only made digital files, but did not provide video of working prototype and he do not want to send it to my home with tracking number. 
What should I do that Upwork will solve this problem in my favour, because I really do not want to loose money on something I did not get.
 
Thank you for all your answers and help.
 
Best regards, Lutz

If I have an existing job (invite-only) that I've posted and have even hired for, and then I make some modifications to the description or other job details (i.e. wage, duration) - will the freelancers that I've already sent the job to (or hired) see those changes?  Or will they simply see the job posting as it originally was? Thanks!

Hello, I have some questions about the Kindle. I have a ""Learn Chinese"" website with sounds, Chinese characters and English on it. I am wondering if someone can port it to the Kindle... 1) Does the Kindle support Chinese characters, that is, Chinese mixed with English on the same page?2) Does Kindle support audio files? On my webpages, you click on the button to hear the audio file. Can you have audio files on the Kindle?  3) Can I embed Video files on the Kindle? I know I can embed photos, but can I  video, too? Thank you

	How to cancel a job and get a refund, without any fault of the Freelancer
","Feb 20, 2019  02:31:47 AM","
Hello, Yesterday I posted a job and accepted a bid from a Freelancer. I then uploaded the money of the project to Escrow. I had not given the freelancer any details of the job and they had not started it. I found out that the job was not needed and I now need to cancel the job and would like to get a refund. The Freelancer is fine with cancelling. How do I cancel the job, get a refund and ensure that there is no penalty for the Freelancer? I would not want a bad rating to be caused as they have not done anything wrong.

I hired a guy yesterday with some specific instructions regarding my Sales funnel. 4.5 hours later he says it's all done - but when I checked, nothing works. I can hardly believe it. He must have lied about his skills!  I'm happy to pay if he can prove he's done what I asked and I'm in the wrong (but I don't think so). I have ended the contract and sent him specific details of what I aksed for and what he hasn't done.  He's charged me 4.5 hours and wasted about a whole day of my time. My question is, how do I lodge a dispute about this - I couldn't find anything on Upwork platform. I feel like charging him for all the time I've wasted on this - and I still don't have a funnel working!

So I may have messed up here. I applied for a job posting and having discussed pricing, was offered a different job (with lower pay) than the one advertised.

In good faith I began work, a little later than normal as I was unsure about the lack of contract.I completed the work and sent it to the client, expecting to get paid that day.I asked them for notes and they said they would get back to me and have since asked for payment, but have no response. Can I dispute this or do I figuratively have no leg to stand on? Thanks for your help! EE

	Freelancer logged way too many hours
","Feb 2, 2018  09:09:36 PM","
I created a project asking a programmer to create a simple project. I started it, did most of the hard work like getting it to connect to BigCommerce and another API. I gave them clear instructions, answered their questions, and spent 2 hours on the phone with them. After a week they asked some questions and I gave some feedback. I didn't realize he had billed me 14 hours for that week because he manually added the hours on Friday. This week, he has logged 10 more hours for a total of 24 and the changes I got were minimal.  In our emails back and forth, I learned that he is billing me 2 hours because he had to learn how to add Log4J to the project, another couple hours because Eclipse would not compile Groovy properly and so he installed IntelliJ which is what I use and got the project working. And then a few more hours saying he had to read my code and learn about it because I didn't use Angular 4 but was using Angular 1. And he didn't know Jersey to build a REST application but only knew Spring REST. I should have learned about all this during the interview and 2-hour phone call but I didn't. He assured me that he could handle the project and since I was so busy, I took him at his word. Now, 2 weeks later, hardly any of the work is done and I'm being billed 24 hours. I want to dispute it, but I see no way to do that. There are 10 hours logged this week and I have paused the project. I don't want to pay those 10 hours as I have already paid 14 for last week and have gotten very little for his efforts. What do I do? There has to be a way to dispute this. So far the only advice I see is that you move on and let them have the money. As an UpWork freelancer myself, I find that highly unethical and would never do that to a client. As someone on the hiring side, it makes me want to avoid UpWork like the plague. Please advise me as to what I can do.

	Account was suspended for posting a Craigslist VA ad for no valid reason.
","Feb 15, 2019  09:49:38 AM","
My account was suspended for no reason for posting a Craiglist VA ad. I specifically used the same exact verbiage of other approved job postings to make sure there were no issues. I've also referenced Craigslist's terms of service and there is no violation of my ad posting. I've spent over an hour on chat with customer support with a requested ""supervisor"" who is non-US based and I've been told there is nothing he can do and I have to wait 24-48 hours. I've requested to speak to a manager multiple times and he said they are too busy. I then asked the so called ""supervisor"" what manager he asked and he proceeds to change his story and says he checked their calendar and they are in a meeting. This is costing me both time and money and I have a time-sensitive project I needed worked on ASAP. I have made many hires and never had any issues. For Upwork to do this to a long-standing client is completely unacceptable. It's even more unacceptable that the so-called ""supervisor"" keeps lying and changing reasons why I can't speak to a manager. First, they said they are busy, then they are in a meeting, then they are in back to back meetings, now they are in meetings all day long.  After reviewing their BBB listing they have over 26 complaints and a 1.5 star rating. For a company that bases its entire company on a ratings based system it is absurd they provide customer service that would get them suspended on their own platform. I will be filing a complaint with the BBB because this is unacceptable.

Hello, I have a client who hired me to work on a hourly contract. I started working and it is assumed that the client should review my daily work and have 5 days to dispute the hours or review my work. Well, the client did not check my work NEVER, and therefore I thought that there was no problem.  I delivered the work done, and now the client appears again and says that she wants a refund for ALL hours done (about 10 hours in total).  I worked for two weeks and she did NOT REVIEWED MY WORK or the screenshots, and she did not disputed the hours, which has 5 days to do it.  I do not accept to make a refund because it is not my fault that she did not reviewed my work on time, I did not do anything wrong, I delivered the work.  It seems to me a lack of logic that for two weeks she has not reviewed anything, and suddenly she asks me for a refund without giving me an explanation.  Also, she didn't told me nothing about the work done (logo design) No feedback, no comments... :/ Now she says she's going to talk to meditation team. My question is: ¿what will happen now? ¿Am I obliged to make a refund to this unresponsive client?  If the client has 5 days to review the hours and he does not, it is not my fault. ¿What should i do now? ¿What meditation team will do? I hope you can help me.

I remembered hearing about upwork so thought I 'd give it a shot. I emailed the freelancer back twice today while I was at work but have not heard back.

	Poor Quality Freelancer
","Feb 9, 2019  03:40:08 AM","
Hello Upwork Community, I am hoping to get some advice from other clients on what they have done in a similar situation. But I hired a freelancer on a website development project 2 months ago.  The developer made many commitments written in a contract which were much better than other freelancers such as doing the website in nodejs and reactjs as opposed to PHP laravel, do it a lower cost than other freelancers and in a shorter period of time. They also promised that they will have a project manager available 24 hours and I will get daily feedback on my project.   As the project started they soon advised that they cannot complete the project the agreed time period and they need an extra month. They did not provide daily updates rather updates a few days later and the work progress was very slow. They asked for funds to be released earlier than usual and most importantly I just got an email from them saying that they cannot complete the project in the decided language anymore as their developer who would work on this has to leave for medical reasons and now they can only code this website in PHP laravel. Please note one of the reason the project was assigned to this team because they committed to doing the project in nodejs and reactjs. If anyone can advise on some feedback on their experiences in a similar situation and what they did. Thank you again to everyone in the community.

	Dispute comes to light after contract ended - how to raise the problem?
","Feb 8, 2019  04:26:49 PM","
I used bookeepers who were charging me per week on Upwork. They made lots of errors and my accountants in the UK had to charge me extra to fix them. The bookeepers on upwork knowing I would raise a dispute then once my year end accounts were completed, quickly closed the contract.
I have proof from my accountants the errors were costly and substantial and could only be discovered after the work was done, and the help of the bookeepers was needed to correct them at the direction of my UK accountants, so we could not raise the dispute during their weekly billing.
The bookeepers are now ignoring communication and I cannot even find where to leave feedback - as its after they closed the contract, but I need to reclaim $2500 from them which is aprox half of what I paid them during the life of the contract. The firm is **edited for Community Guidelines**. They have lots of people who have 'no feedback left' as they must have done the same trick on them too - leaving a trail of costly mistakes. I even had the UK authorities sending a letter to shut down the company. These people are dangerous in my opinion.

	Cannot manage job post
","Feb 8, 2019  12:22:10 AM","
Hi there I'm hoping someone in the community can assist as I haven't heard back from the Upwork team for a few days now. My account setup seems to be rather confused. Problems started when I created a test client account to understand how best to guide someone to invite me to their client team. We eventually got the invite right and I joined their team but created a job posting under my test client account by accident. To prevent this happening in future, I deleted the client account - which ended up removing my entire account (note that I had a freelancer account for a few years already).  I tried creating a new account but got an error message stating that this typically doesn't happen, but something went wrong (and of course a link to 'contact support' which goes to help docs and no way to actually create a support ticket because I no longer had a working Upwork account. I asked the client to log a ticket on my behald and eventually Upwork support got involved and reactivated my account as well as deleted the test client account and I was requested to ask the client to invite me to their team again. Which I did. However I couldn't accept the invitation as kept defaulting me back to my freelancer landing page. Many emails backwards and forward - including recording my screen, clearing data and history and trying on 3 different browsers I was told that the matter had been escalted to the dev team and I would hear back. A day passes - no news. During this time I receive emails of proposals for the job posting I had made in error (against a test client that had since been deleted - note that I needed to remove the live job posting before I could delete the test client account the first time around). Of course clicking through those emails resulted in me being served an access denied page. Eventually I decide to create a new account with a different email address, as I can no longer wait to hear back from my ""escalated case"". I do so and request client invites me to their team again. Which they do and I accept. For some reason I have no visibility of the job posting (which I am meant to be managing), however with a shared link I can access the proposals and candidate workflow. Interestingly enough, during this time, I still receive emails on the old email address for the ""delisted"" job against the ""deleted"" client account. Now logged in and authenticated with the new email address and new client, when I click those emails I get into that listings candidate workflow. Something is rather broken with authorisation within the system. The new account I am using has access to a job that shouldn't exist and a different client and the client I am meant to be working with, I can't access unless given a direct URL. I really am hoping someone can assist with a way forward as time is now of the essence. Thanks in advance.Jennifer

	Pushy, inappropriate agencies
","Feb 1, 2019  01:51:25 AM","
Coming out of forum retirement to complain once again about completely inappropriate behavior from translation agencies. I have several jobs open currently where I am looking for legal translation at fairly short notice. Normally I say in the job that I don't want agencies, but because I need to cast a wider net than usual I decided to not rule out agencies in the job post. An agency applied for my Polish legal translation job, putting forward a Spanish freelancer. When I declined their proposal as an obvious qualifications mismatch, they somehow tracked down my personal Skype account and contacted me on there saying that they are an agency and they have a Polish translator. I doubt they will read this but maybe other freelancers will: it is NEVER appropriate to continue to try to contact a client through channels outside Upwork if they have already declined you. Yes, even if you think they are wrong. You will not win their business. You will instead rule yourself out from ever being hired by that client, and any other clients they may know. Take the rejection and move on.

Hi there, I have been searching high and low for advice for reporting Upwork payments as deductions.  My final step will be to upgrade on TurboTax for their advice, however, this is the last thing I need to report so I am attempting to avoid it. Scenario: I used a few freelance app developers and designers to start and continue development on my small business project.  There are the actual milestone payments and Upwork fees associated with each.  My question is, 1 how do you classify the actual payment to the freelancer as a deduction (or can you even do this), and 2 same with the fees associated?  These will actually continue into 2019, so whatever advice I can get here will help with the following year as well.  Also, I understand responses will be mostly responses through experience or opinions  Thanks!

I hired a freelancer to work on my job.His quality of work is poor and he does not follow the instructions that I asked ( what program he needs to use or what errors he needs to fix). Then he suddenly requested a fund before he has completed the milestone ( he said that he need urgent money since he will be a father next Wednesday). I checked his work that he has done so far, I found many things that I asked him to fix he has not done and still neglect errors. So I asked him to fix but he said this is not his job and he did another thing already.           Then I paid partly fund according to his work ( he completed less than %50 of the job ).  and I think it will trouble me more than useful since I have to fix all of his work by myself. So I decide to end the contract.          Then he threatens me about escrow money that I put in the milestone"" I m not going to easily release escrow money without an answer""""Follow standard step of Upwork. Be ready for claim.""and want $100 more.  I refuse to pay $100 I paid as Bonus for $20 + $60 for his 2-days work.  total ($80 / $250). It is better to stop now because It will damage me more when the project is completed and I have to manufacture this error-prone work.          He demanded more money ($100 more ) and 10 point score for feedback if I want to release my Escrow money. So now he opened the Dispute and what I should do next?             I do not want to hire him anymore ( quite aggressive replies sometime and bad quality of works ) what should I do in the next step?

I'm suspicious of my contractor's activity logs. He's real, responsive on email & skype, and generally says the right things.  I chose him because he logged 2000+ hours of work and had a 5 star rating.  However, when I look at his activity logs, I see constant screenshots of the same screen with 0-14 keystrokes per minute and mostly 0 mouse activity.  His comments are the same ""working on development"" or such things.  Productivity is very low. During the first week, they did some real work - the activity logs were very different and had much more activity.  Now it seems he's billing me for work, but the screenshots are barely changing.  He'll send me a message with a tiny work update each day, but mostly its very little work. Anyone have advice on how to map activity to actually doing work?   It seems like odesk should be able to detect this via automation. ThanksMike

I hired 4 freelancers to make a custom Gantt chart for $50 each because of a tight deadline and I didn't want to waste time if I found out I hired the wrong person.The task requires complicated scripts and formulas.2 of the freelancers did work for less money but I can't use their Gantt charts because if you are not very careful the formulas break and errors occur, for example if you delete a cell with a formula accidently.I paid them and rated them 4 stars anyway. The 3rd freelancer had 3 days to complete task, it has been 5 days and he likely won't be finished for another week. He has done a lot of work so far but the Gantt chart has the same problems as the others and I doubt his skills.The fourth freelancer is an incredibly skilled superhuman genius that far exceeded my expectations in quality of work. He has finished but is now doing extra work to make it even better. I will give him a $200 bonus.What should I do with the 3rd freelancer?Cancel the contract and don't pay him. Then I can give an extra $50 to the 4th freelancer.Or just pay the 3rd freelancer and rate him 4 stars?Let him finish the work because he might end up doing a great job but I doubt it.

","Jan 29, 2019  06:11:00 PM","
Hello Folks, I have not yet created a project on here, however, just preparing for the worst I only have a question related if a dispute ever happens. I intend to create a contract document between myself and the potential freelancer about building a website for me. However, I am creating the contract in the form of delivering a 100% full functioning and accepted product, not as a paid service through effort and time. So, If the freelancer agrees to those terms and a dispute occurs for whatever reason, normally, if the product has not been delivered and accepted then a full refund is expected to the buyer as per the contract, is that a safe assumption? Alternatively, will this go through a dispute process where the buyer will have to compensate the freelancer for work done even though the contract says otherwise?

	wrong invoice amounts on Upwork invoices
","Mar 16, 2018  06:02:23 AM","
Reports -> Transactions menu shows invoices which for some reason don't match our credit card payments. For example, for a recent job I've posted, our credit card charge is $308,25 - however, the invoice amount is only $300. Where is the missing $8? Invoices which don't match the payments amounts are useless according to our accounting and will raise tax investigation against our company -- therefore, we need a proper invoice from Upwork.

Hello,This platform is the worst when claiming ""rights"" as a Client, and should be avoided.In my case I just got defauded by a Freelancer, which had the total support from Upwork politics to behave in that way. Just for a fact, Upwork said... Quality is responsibility of the Client, but ""Client"" does not have any tool, right to claim it while using Upwork as middleware. Just check this out. Just check this...Create Hourly Contract Hire a FreelancerSet your terms & settings (useless without any relevant meaning for Upwork by the way)Tell the freelancer to do you ""thing""Check periodically the work when freelancer uses the Desktop Application, he probably is doing something.After a few hours you ask for the ""thing"", but freelancer say I dont have it, please take this screenshot of my desktop, the ""thing"" is done.... wt?...Pause the contract (your only tool) to avoid be charged for extra hours when asking the freelancer to fix the problem and claim your ""thing""...Freelancer say no way, and ended the contract......wt?!...Now you will be charged for the hours that person worked... so obviously you will dispute... during dispute Freelancer says:I assume that is what you wanted! ...... seriously?after a couple of messages without any conclusive argue/discussionUpwork team will come to ""rescue"" to the Freelancer, saying that his politics for Hourly contract are clear, quality is your issue... so you will pay for a TV Show, just to what a person working on his computer, do not receive the ""thing"" requested, and yes, be insulted by the platform asking you... why did you choose an Hourly Contract anyway?... and yes you cannot open a new dispute for that ridiculous resolution...  My question is Why to have so painful procedure to create a ""Contract"" and Job Terms if are useless, If the quality is my ""issue"", then is my Right to claim it, but what tool does Upwork provides?  Just take a look (is Community decide to edit this message)Ticket number #23957374

I've got a fixed rate contarct with a freelancer. I want to set milestones as it's a big project. However, when I add a milestone it adds to the fixed rate contract price. I don't want to add to the contract price. I want to set milestones so that I can release partial payments as the job progresses and each goal is met. So, in my scenario, a milestone would be set with an amount attached; then, when that goal is met, that amount of money is released to the freelancer.

	Recouping money paid to freelancer who DID NOT deliver...
","Jan 16, 2019  07:18:51 PM","
I hired a designer to do what should have been quick work. He requested half up-front, which I was resistant to, but I checked with a marketer friend of mine, and she said that's not uncommon amongst freelance designers or designers with a small company because they tend to get screwed over a lot.  I wanted to be fair (and stated as much in my message to him) and paid 50% up front.  He has been incredibly slow, but yesterday he finally sent me something that made me sufficiently happy.  I asked for the final deliverable (b/c what he showed me didn't meet the size/ resolution specs), and told him I would pay him upon receipt.  He sent me a message telling me that he ran into a problem and to Skype him, THEN he ended the contract.  I told him I would NOT be Skyping him, and that he should message me via Upwork like he has been.  He said his account got closed down and asked me to send him money at some email address.  I told him NO, have reported him to Upwork, and have requested a refund from him.  Obviously I will not pay him any additional money, but if he doesn't give back my money willingly, do I have any other recourse to recoup my funds so that I can use them to pay someone else to ACTUALLY get this done? Thank you.

THEN, I did the correct procedure that was recommended by upwork, to get a refund. I submitted my refund on 11/5/18 and have YET to receive any acknowledgment or any information from my freelancer or upwork. I am forced to get my lawyers involved.

So my Total Debit and Total Credits were 4500. I calculated how much I think I should have paid (while on the phone with an Upwork customer support member), and it was around 2500. Initially Upwork support said Total Credit was how much was charged to my credit card, but then after adding up all payments with me, they said Total Credit is how much was charged to my credit card + amounts initially deposited into escrow (or something like that).  I asked if there was a way to see in my Upwork account the total amount charged. They said no. Wondering if someone can help with this situation?

	Why is Upwork encouraging freelancers to gouge the people hiring them?
","Jan 3, 2019  09:55:23 AM","
Ive used upwork for several years and spent tens of thousands hiring freelancers.  Ive always been a very supportive user and fulfilled my end of the bargain every time.  Im decent to freelancers, give good ratings when warranted and give clear insructions on what to do.  So why is Upwork instructing freelancers to gouge me? When I set out to hire some one I search very carefully - I decide what skills I need and what range of pay is in the budget.  Then I search, review skills and ratings, and interview candidates.  I spend lots of time doing this.  Then I narrow my search down to the right person and offer them the job.  They then raise their rate that was posted.  This NEVER happened until a few months ago.  Now it happens EVERY job.  In one case the rate the freelancer ""offered"" wanted was 400% over their profile rate.  More typical is 30%-50% jump over their profile rate.  This is preposterous. I even asked this particular freelancer why she did that and she basically spilled the beans on Upwork.  She stated that when my offer to hire came in, Upwork encouraged her to raise her rate for my offer (the profile rate stayed the same)!  Seriously?  So I make an offer in good faith and you use my goodwill against me?  Also, very strangely, after I made an offer, I was no longer able to see the candidate's original profile rate - is it being intentionally obscured to prevent employers from seeing the original rate?  This is really a terrible practice. The freelancer should post a rate they are comfortable with and feel they are worth and stick to it for the next person who hires them.  If they feel they are worth more, they should raise their profile rate.  As jobs progress and either the freelancer becomes busier, their skills improve, or the job demands more, the rate can and should be re-negotiated between the two parties.  But Upwork's practice of screwing the employer makes for bad blood between employers and employees and undermines the very purpose of Upwork - a marketplace where people can come together.  One of the most important elements of a market is visibility of pricing.  When you start messing with that, you undermine the very value Upwork brings.

","Jun 26, 2017  03:31:30 AM","
I'd like to hide the rate I pay to my contractors.  It is causing major issues within my teams as they are looking at each other's rate and demanding a raise.  How do I hide their rates? When I hire someone, they agree to a rate.  I pay them what they want, and then they get 50% done and demand a raise because they talk to each other.  It's a bad structure for companies like mine who hire a wide range of talent. Read: Please don't respond to this post by saying, ""Tell them they aren't worth the new rate!"" as I have tried that approach and have lost key personnel.  The value proposition is much bigger than a single person's rate.  For example, a sample budget is:Total Budget = {[Total Salary for all Freelancers] + [Overhead Costs] + [Fixed Costs] + [Risk Variance]} A person(s) who asks for a raise may put the total project outside of budget expectations. A company needs the ability to hide their financial commitments, but how?

	How to report a case of slander by a client
","Dec 29, 2018  04:28:11 AM","
Yesterday a customer showed interest in my proposal (translation of a novel from English into Italian). Instead of explaining in detail the essence and the tasks of the job, she asked me to contact her by phone or give her my profile ""$kype"" (btw, why ""$kype"" and not Skype?). I told her that I preferred to discuss the details of the work in a written way, it is not my working habit to get in touch with the customer by telephone. However, I added that if she really needed to contact me by phone, we could do it the next day, that is today (I was at a conference yesterday). The client told me that it was OK, but after a few seconds, she declined my proposal and BANNED me by motivating it with the fact that I wanted to take her work outside of Upwork, which is not true at all. I simply asked her whether it was ok to have a talk in the following morning. What can I do to avoid being excluded from the Upwork community for dishonest conduct? I mean, she is absolutely slandering me! Thanks in advance for any suggestion.**Edited for community guidelines**

So I posted an urgent job yesterday.  Zip.  Nada.  No proposals.  Even though I included international visibility, nothing came in overnight.    So, I boosted my job post.  It is like $30.  But, I am scratching my head.  What the heck does it do?  I would think you guys can get alerts if a job matches your skills or if something new comes up.  So, it should be ordered by time submitted and by category.  Therefore, by this logic, there's nothing to ""boost"" or ""feature.""  What does this really do? What do you you think when you see a ""boosted""/""featured"" job?  On google, I ignore any links that are ads, since they aren't the ""real"" best links to click to get my answers.  Do you do the same?

Hello! This might be a bit of a silly question, but when I click on the profile dropdown (top right of every Upwork page), I can see my photo next to my ""Freelancer"" profile, but there isn't a photo next to my ""Client"" profile. The photo is there when I click on the settings for my ""Client"" profile, so I know it's definitely been uploaded.  I have a feeling freelancers I hire can't see my photo either.  Is there a reason for this, and/or anything that can be done about it?  Thanks very much! Mish

	Why was my account suspended?
","Dec 17, 2018  05:49:11 AM","
I just opened an account and posted my first job. Looking for someone to do some data entry work for a freelance recruiting job, so the post was pretty straightforward (looking for a person who can read and digest information quickly, and enter data into Excel). I was pretty surprised to see the post taken down and my account suspended within moments of the job going live. 
 
I think the job description was fairly non-controversial (I'm in recruiting; I write job descriptions for a living), but my account was suspended nonetheless. There was no clear reason giving except that it implied that the advert seemed like a scam or scheme of some type.

	applicable law and jurisdiction for the Optional Service Contract Terms
","Dec 13, 2018  09:17:27 AM","
Could somebody kindly assist with the below? It is my understanding that the Optional Service Contract Terms apply automatically between Users, in the absence of any other agreement between Client and Freelancer. However, it is unclear to me what the applicable law and jurisdiction of these Optional Service Contract Terms are, or even if there are any. Indeed, if one refers to the second paragraph of the User Agreement, the Optional Service Contract Terms are not listed in the agreements that collectively constitute the Terms of Service. This Agreement includes and hereby incorporates by reference the following important agreements, as they may be in effect and modified from time to time: Site Terms of Use; Fee and ACH Authorization Agreement; Cookie Policy; Privacy Policy; Mark Use Guidelines; Freelancer Membership Agreement; Proprietary Rights Infringement Reporting Procedures; Upwork App Software License Agreement; API Terms of Use; and the escrow instructions as applicable to any Service Contract you enter into with another User, specifically the Hourly, Bonus, and Expense Payment Agreement with Escrow Instructions; and Fixed-Price Escrow Instructions. These agreements are collectively, with this Agreement, called the “Terms of Service”. Besides, article 14.2 of this User Agreement which states the following is headed by “Disputes between you and Upwork”. Therefore I understand it is not applicable for disputes between Users themselves. 14.2 CHOICE OF LAWThese Site Terms of Use, the other Terms of Service, and any Claim will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law provisions and excluding the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG); provided, however, that any Claims made by any Freelancer located within the United States will be governed by the law of the state in which such Freelancer resides. However, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, this Arbitration Provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq.). Could you confirm whether my analysis is correct and advise as to the practice when “choosing” by default the Optional Service Contract Terms? Do Client and Freelancer generally enter into an addendum to specify the applicable law and jurisdiction?

	How to speak about job requirements (time, remuneration) before posting it?!?!?!
","Dec 6, 2018  04:39:21 PM","
This annoys me to no end, and is the reason why I can't use Upwork. As a non-developer, I'm expected to first know exactly how much a job will cost, and how long it will take. Then I can post a job, or hire a person directly. Then the bloody discussion about what is involved, realistic expectations ammend the job, etc. This doesn't work for me becuase if my guess is too low, no one responds. If my guess is too high, or perfect, everyone under the sun applies and there is no filter. You get some freelancer part of some major business in south asia applying. So. How do I speak about the job, with a suitable candidate, to determine the full scope of work needed, how long and realistic/appropriate remuneration?!?!?! So far there is no ability. Perhaps I am wrong, but here is a mesage to Upwork.Stop forcing me to create a contract of which I know nothing about, just to talk to a freelancer.Allow us to contact and speak to freelancers. Freelancers, if you think this is not fair, help us understand time required for jobs and remmuneration. ""Hire someone first, and then talk about what's needed"" - who accepts this?

After telling that he agreed to finish the work without any additional costs. BUT after that he has not done anything but giving excuses. Last time he did small edits 6 months ago where he probably used less than 1h. At the moment we don´t have anything, not even working link for the sketch page.

Hi, I am hiring a new freelancer (no previous jobs) and the person asks for payment upfront saying he is starting the job right away. Thing is, he is not submitting anything, no screenshot, nothing. 1. This is very suspicious.2. IMO, your site should allow a request, if and only if, the freelancer submit something, an attachement of any kind. Then it is our responsability to check the attachment if it makes sense or not.3. Your team should 'advertise' a document, a note, something explaining  to new clients, and new freelancers, how the usual process of submission/request payment should go. The experience is pretty bad as-is...  Thx

	Seeing less quality developers from India
","Sep 6, 2014  03:47:55 AM","
			
				
					
					
						Hi,

I have been hiring on odesk past 6 years. We have hired over 350 freelancers so far.

I have been trying to find a good senior web developer . Each time I post a job i get 80% applications from India web developers. Everyone seem to have good rating with 1000+ hours. But when we hand over the task, they are pathetic.

1. They lack clear communications.

2. They dont take note of the requirement

3. They miss deadlines

4. Not even one developer followed a project management tool .

5. Most importantly, some of them take 10 hours to do a job that must take 1 hour.

In comparision, those who we found from other countries such as romania, russia, armenia are very focussed and ensure its delivered as we want, on time with clear communications.


So I am starting to wonder, all those good ratings they have got, do all clients leave honest review?

Odesk really needs to do something about this before it becomes a place where we cant trust the ones we hire and waste money and time on these developers.

There is a great need for more quality developers.

Atleast tag those superior quality developers. Even those odesk recommended came in with lack of quality.

	Fixed-Price Protection For clients
","Dec 6, 2018  10:08:23 PM","
Hi all,I have hired a freelancer with fixed price contract $3000. I have added full amount to milestone. He was going to deliver things on milestone date. Once the payment is in escrow, he stopped responding to me. I have chased him everywhere other than upwork messages and asking for updates. He started passing 14 days escrow with reply Coming soon to you ..... etc., after 3 days when I have not received any proper deliverable and response I found it suspicious and immediately cancelled the contract. All events happened within six days from starting and cancelling the project. As soon as I cancelled the contact he contacted me and first told me, he has already sent the deliverable/some document to my email. Later he asked if I have not received anything, I can get the document by making the payment to him. I have not received any single document/deliverable either in my email or as in up-work attachment. Since case was clear and he was not looking reliable, I decided not to go ahead and started planning to hire other freelancer. He disputed the money and shared the deliverable with upwork team and asking payment. Up-work team has recommended for AAA. I am not sure which document/deliverable he has shared with up-work team asking $3000 for one document.  As recommended by upwork, I have decided to go with AAA. Freelancer always asked me to hire him directly with upfront payment of $3000 and shared proposals outside upwork. To make it safer, I hired him through up-work with escrow payment available and never signed any contract outside up-work. I want to know What guarantee does Up-work provide for clients regarding the fixed contract? I have gone through the upwork terms, and it has clear indication of supporting my case but I am not sure about it.

	Warning: Time Tracker Bots
","Dec 6, 2018  05:54:46 AM","
I've been on eLance/UpWork for over 15 years as a Client, outsourcing hundreds of jobs with over $1M spent. I typically hire developers based in India, Ukraine, Pakistan, and sometimes China. The projects are typically code related and we always agree to use the time tracker to bill hours. 
 
Recently, in a few cases, I am seeing that the devs are using some kind of desktop software to fake mouse and keyboard activity, inflating their hours billed. I am attaching an example of a provider having consecutive 10 minute screenshot periods on the same file open with no keyboard activity and only minimal mouse activity. That means they were simply looking at the open file for 30+ minutes with almost no keyboard strokes. The assigned task in this particular case was simply to apply some pre-existing code from nother file and paste it into the file that is open. I have seen this in at least two other projects and will be dealing with the providers directly. I am simply putting this up here as a note to Clients to not become overly reliant on the time tracker. This is not an individual case. The one provider attached is with one of UpWorks biggest providers. **Edited for Community Guidelines**

Hi I have now posted a job twice for an in person translator. The postion as explained is clearly paid but it keeps being removed because it says that it includes unpaid work.

	Do not force me to state a budget
","Nov 24, 2018  09:23:34 PM","
Look - I have no incentive to give up this important information. I understand it makes it easier for freelancers, but why in the world would I give them that information? I share budgets upfront with trusted freelancers with whom I have an established relationship - not as the first step in finding work.
 
I understand the need for you to protect freelancers from wasting their time, but there has to be a better way. Other companies have used budget ranges - but sometimes I just don't know. I don't have a budget - I'm trying to put a quote together for a client, and looking for subcontractors.
 
This is what upwork has to offer you when you set a high budget. Freelancers ready to take advantage of you - no matter how obvious. Are these even people bidding, or just bots. Anyway - This is what happens when you put a $70,000 budget on a $100 project. More than 50% of my current applicants, including 2 ""BEST MATCH"" picks.

If anyone needs an artist I would not recommend this one. **edited for Community Guidelines**, although talented is not a professional individual. I hired **edited for Community Guidelines** to do the artwork for my graphic novel and it took him a year and a half to produce only 20 pages. He was paid upfront for 30 pages which he didn't complete and since he requested to be paid with PayPal, up work is not aware of the transaction. He is also very bad with his communication and keeping you updated or meeting any kind of deadlines. I believe he may have taken one too many projects at once.

I've been a little confused about the best way to do this, but I want to check that I'm setting up an ongoing contract in the best way. I have a contractor or two who will help me with maintaining some websites. The work is rather sporatic, with some months having a number of tasks followed by some months of nothing.  Should I just create a job per task set and then close it when it's done? Is there a good way to setup an ongoing relationship? I want to make sure the contractors are paid in a timely way, but leaving a job open seems to limit them getting good feedback and I get alerts about the job auto-closing after some time. Any tips would be greately appreciated.

	Fixed-Price work paid in Advance and work never received.
","Nov 27, 2018  03:50:28 PM","
I have hired a freelance for a fixed price of 1500$. He suggested to divide the work in 2 milestones. After the first milestone reached the deadline he asked me to pay, and then he suggested to start the second one and to pay. When I asked if I had to close the contract, he said YES and he got all the money. After that he kept asking me more and more money. I refused saying that the price was fixed, and after that he never delivered any other work. I opened a dispute and now he is saying to the Support that he made the work. I have pratically lost all the money. Nobody can help me. He got 1500$ and he is keeping lying. Nothing else to do. These are the nice freelances in this website and it is frustrating that Upwork doesn't and can't do anything. Just 1500$ lost.

	Very abusive client
","Nov 27, 2018  01:25:58 PM","
Hi,I have been working on Upwork since May 2018 and had been positive experiences so far. But few days back I was invited to a job about redesigning a website. So, I write a cover letter and he asked to add me on skype for further conversation. During conversation, I clearly mention about my skills to the client that I'll re-design the website on WordPress and he said that is totally fine for him.after few days, He said this site needs to be redesigned on his existing code which is built in PHP and the code was really messy and outdated! Still, I continued working on this since he was really pressurizing me. But later on, I realized that in order to make the project finished I need to do extra work that was way out of scope.
So finding no other option I had to cancel the order and explained to him very politely why I had to cancel it but after this, he got ferocious and continuously threatening me about ruining my career here on Upwork and using very abusive words and slangs on both Skype and Upwork.I'm sharing a very few messages that he sent me on Upwork chat with quote **Edited for community guidelines**This is the most disgraceful and immoral conduct that any freelancer can expect from a client. I want to mention that this client joined Upwork very recently (11th November 2018) and found out that he hired another freelancer before me for the same job and she also couldn't able to complete the task.I contacted Upwork support about this incident with a Screenshots yesterday. but today he is threatening me again saying that I damaged his site and he's gonna complain about this whereas I haven't changed any single line of his site. This client continuously upsetting me where I was being polite and generous from the beginning. 
I hope Upwork authorities will come up with a solution that would prevent clients from such behavior and protect freelancers.Thanks.

I wanted to state it categorically that you people encourage your freelancer to scam your client, especially developer from outside USA to scam America citizen from their hard earning.
(1) Since i filled the dispute to encourage the developer to complete the job, they immediately stop communication because they believed they can only loose the money in escrow and get away with the released payment.
(2)**edited for Community Guidelines** with 84% job success rate from **edited for Community Guidelines** 91% won the project but he told me his account cannot process payment because of temporary hold on his account from upwork, he now introduce **edited for Community Guidelines** to handle the project. my question is why you allow developer from the same company to scam people, why can’t you block the company account instead of individual account, by blocking the company account they will take the necessary step to solve their issue
(3)the payment method is a credit card not debit card, it is a loan , i can’t lose $6000 and be paying money back to the bank.
(4)i could have easily charge back the payment without stress since I did not receive any product i paid for, but i am considering the other freelancer that is managing my project because i wanted him to maintain his 100% job success rate, because if i charge back upwork would suspend my account and i will charge all payment to you back which will affect my good freelancer (**edited for Community Guidelines**).
To avoid this situation i implore you to convey my messages to management to get my money back EITHER THROU ABITTRATION OR ANY MEAN, I CAN’T AVOILD TO LOSE $6000.

	Paying good freelancers
","Nov 16, 2018  10:07:32 AM","
I have one UW freelancer, two from another platform and four totally offline. Poor quality is unacceptable. Great quality is the goal, and I have to pay for that. My VA is from UW; I gave him a 25% pay raise immediately to ensure his continuing availability. I just told my website freelancer to raise her rates 25% so I could just pay the invoice instead of adding a 25% tip each time. My need for research is mostly met now by my VA, but the disabled vet I pay for research (he's adequate and refuses charity) just got a 40% raise. My go-to editor won't accept a raise because she charges on single rate to everybody. Same for my go-to graphics artist. The issue isn't so much the money, it's making them feel appreciated and encouraging them to be available. If you have a one-time job and find mediocre work acceptable, by all means pay as little as you can. You deserve the results. If you have a continuing need for a freelancer's abilities, pay well. Just as long-time clients are valuable, so are long-time freelancers.

	Adding extra funds into milestone
","Nov 15, 2018  07:45:31 AM","
I'm a freelancer and I have a question on behalf of my client who assigned me to do a job.The situation is that the full price for the job is $1,050. The client only had $300 on his credit card and he therefore paid $300 into the milestone and we agreed on him adding the rest of the funds onto his credit card, so he could add the last $750.Just now he tried to add the $750 into the milestone, but he wasn't able to, so he tried to make a seconds milestone, but he can't seem to add the funds into that one either.My question is: How do he add the extra funds ino the first milestone?

	A critical feature is missing for Clients - average freelancer activity level over a day
","Nov 13, 2018  10:17:14 AM","
Upwork is currently missing a basic and necessary feature, which is the average freelancer activity level over a day or a month. Without this feature, there is no simple way to see the average activity level of a freelancer for a day. I cannot easily tell if a freelancer is staying active or not. This is basic functionality that would take about 20 minutes to develop. I spoke with support and they told me that this feature doesn't exist and needs to be requested by Clients to be added.  They gave me a ticket #22913926 for this request. Clients, please reach out to support and request this feature. This would help us all.

	Automatic Refund
","Nov 13, 2018  10:38:39 AM","
Hi Everyone,  I encountered a really unusual issue a while ago. I received an email saying that I refunded this much amount back to the client while I did no such thing.  I don't know how did it happen but this is what I know when I searched for what could be the reason. This issue was with an hourly contract where I put manual time on the time tracker. I have been adding manual time in the tracker and never had such issue. I don't know what has caused this to happen. After waiting for 10 days and finally when I thought I would receive my payment, this issue popped up.  Solutions would be appreciated and let me know what are the things I can avoid in future.  Thank you!

Over the course of my time on Upwork, I’ve noticed that when clients have gotten their contracts suspended (seemingly due to a lack of funds on their cards) they disappear, vanish, and conveniently stop responding to messages. This is common with certain hourly projects that I’ve worked on when clients’ contracts have gotten suspended.

So I tried a different email address and it registered. After doing so successfully I figured now I will update my email address to the old one I used but nope it wouldn't allow me.

But guess what if you haven't alreay: I need to be logged in to post here...UGHHH...Hence I am posting here with THIRD account for any admin to please help me open first account so I may close this promptly.

	Adding Milestones Increases Budget

I created fixed-price contracts and put the entire amount in escrow. Now I try to add milestones and it doubles the budget. The first milestone can't be changed and my freelancers are requesting full payment for only completing the first milestone! So I create the project for $1,000 and put the full amount in escrow. Subsequently I try to go back and add project milestones, each one for a smaller amount, all totalling $1000. Now my project budget has gone to $2000.  There is no way to change the amount associated with the first milestone. My freelancers submit work and it requests payment of the entire $1000 ""first milestone"". I can't afford to pay double price on these projects. Does anyone know a good workaround? This software interface is going to be a showstopper for me if I can't figure this out.  Thanks,Nosu

When I went to invite some freelancers to a job I posted on my Client account, one of my Agency freelancers appeared as an option.  While the 20% fee almost seems worth it in getting him his first few ratings/jobs, it does seem like it would be (or should be) a violation of Upworks terms of service.

I am a big fan of Upwork and find it very helpful however my recent experience is very concerning, a freelancer is currently threatening me.I was not happy with this freelancers work because he kept making mistakes when working on my website. I closed the contract and offered to pay him some money for the work he did, which I thought was fair. He then went straight psychopath.Here is a selection of what he has said:‘You got the wrong person to play your game with.’‘you are not the first person that tried this play with me’‘You think you are the only one who can pay 5$ for fake reviews?’‘there is no way that I will forget this....you better hire someone good, cause some **bleep** is about to rain on you..’After trying to have a polite chat with this the freelancer I realised that there was no point trying to tell him my point of view. So in between threats I said I’ll pay him the full money (even though the work wasn’t done well and the tasks aren’t completed), I even said I’d leave him a 5 star review – just to calm him down.100% pycho doesn’t want the 5* review or to be paid now. He is just very very angry.As this guy does SEO I am now concerned he is going to do some black hat spam SEO, leave fake reviews online etc.This guy has earned $20k+ is a ‘top talent’ and has a great looking profile.I have tried contacting Upwork but I just get sent links to articles I should read.What can I do?!

	Invite Freelancers for Little Projects
","Oct 18, 2018  10:34:26 AM","
hi guys,i am a freelance and often i read some little projects, easy and fast, that could be done for free or something like that.But when a Client post the job without sending invites, the only possibility for a freelance is ""pay"" the connects..I don't do that, becasue connects are never enough!I think that if you should send invites, you could have more possibilities to assign the job to the right person.But this is just my 2 cents

	Not satisfied with a freelancer!
","Oct 22, 2018  07:44:05 AM","
Hey, I hired a freelancer to write me a short book. I set the due date to 07-11-18. She delivered today, so 2 weeks earlier. The book is full with grammatic issues and most of the sentences just end in weird ways or doesn't make any sense at all. It'd take me days to correct it all. All in all I'm absolutely not willing to pay any cent for that, because I could've done it way better on my own in the same time, if I had the time, but thats way I hired her right .. What can I do from here on? Just Cancel the Contract? I mean she's probably not willing to let me do that so she will dispute it... How can I proceed from here and is there any security for me to get my money back?

I came here to post a bright new shiny job and saw this notice:  ""Financial transactions for **edited for Community Guidelines** have been limited.""So I went to billing and saw that my c card had expired.  I updated all the information with a new expiration date, checked my email for verification from UW, click, click,  and all looked good.But the message persists and I can't post the job.  I go to ""Customer Support"", what a joke...a bot.
Nothing but unrelated responses and then finally an advisement to clear my cache/browser.Did that, logged back in and the same message persisted about my financial limitations.Checked my billing section again and all updated with new card verified.Nope, can't post a new job.Who needs this hassle when there's **edited for Community Guidelines**t?How stupid is UpWork for making it hard for me to give them money????

	Dispute
","Oct 18, 2018  10:46:53 AM","
the madness of this platform has no limits, I hired a freelancer for a given contract, the contract foresaw the completion of 10 tasks, for different reasons he refused to continue, so I released only part of the sum, the freelancer opened a dispute, obviously has not shown with concrete facts to have completed my work, so Upwork is now reinventing the wheel, refuses to give me the money back, unless of a legal practice that I did not understand. I am very tempted to open a dispute with Paypal, since these agents who handle disputes are obviously incapable people, as they admitted themselves, even if not directly.

	Accounting for taxes. Upwork transaction report hard to understand.
","Oct 16, 2018  08:31:39 AM","
I find the transcations report to be a complete mess in upwork. I would love to see two things that would make life so much easier:- A receipt for each job, how much I paid, date of completion of the job, total payments including the processing fees.- A monthly report that makes sense. Currently it's a mess because payments show up a second time when they're paid out of escrow. I just want to see how much I paid this month and download that as an invoice. I'm trying to make things simple when keeping track of my expenses for the IRS and I don't think upwork is helping at all. It's complicated because of the milestones, the escrow, etc but I'm sure there's a better way. How do you all handle that ?

	Fraud, I reported him but he is still on Upwork!
","Oct 13, 2018  07:38:23 AM","
Hello,
 
First, let me say how much I love working with Upwork. I normally choose people from India or Asia as I love the culture and find it easier to work with people that are as humble as I am. Nothing against the rest of the world, it's just my preference. It's always nice to speak with people from other cultures and their cultures intrigue me.
 
This past week, I have had 7 jobs completed in a timely fashion. I always tip when my works do a fantastic job. ""It is better to give than to receive"". I love that Biblical quote and I always try to give when I can.
 
I added another job as I am in need of a NLP guru to help me train a chatbot. I even paid the extra 29.99 so my job would be front and center to the freelancers who specialize in this field. A few days after, I returned to upwork and found a bunch of freelancers that could complete my task. As I started to read the proposals, one proposal stood out.
 
**Edited for Community Guidelines**Ahmed wants $555.00 an hour but only made $5.00. So I decided to read his cover letter.
 
I decided to reply to Ahmed.**Edited for Community Guidelines**Upwork, please remove this person from being a Free Lancer. He is not worthy.

	Upwork suspends my own freelancers

Hello all, I am a new client here. I tried hiring via Upwork however I wasn't able to decide who to hire. Interviewed many however many days later, I didn't find someone who could work. When I found someone and hired him, he didn't start the work for 2 days after I hired him, neither did he respond to my messages. After all this hassle, when I brought to Upwork my own freelancers that can do the job for me as per my expectations (met them via my professional network), Upwork suspended all 3 of them. When I hired the 4th resource (costlier but was able to do the job of 3), Upwork suspended him as well. I am curious to understand whether Upwork is a roadside evening restaurant which is about to close and no longer accepting a new order, therefore not allowing me to get my work done. I need to understand if Upwork doesn't want me to hire anyone here, so that I stop attempting and go elsewhere. Thanks for your advices! Charles E.B.Very Frustated Client!

One of our website that we've hired Upwork freelancers to work has recently been hacked where it shows Japanese characters in search engines.  And I highly suspect (with probable cause) that it was carried out by one of the freelancers whom I was in contact with days earlier who exhibited suspicious behaviors.  However, after reporting this to Upwork, their only response was that they could not find any proof that this freelancer was guilty.  Well they are called hackers for a reason... they don't leave proof! So needless to say this case went unresolved.  Meanwhile this freelancer is still active and online, and is possibly continuing to do this to other gullible clients; and I am very annoyed that he gets away with this...

	Beware of *edited*
","Oct 7, 2018  11:55:05 AM","
Hi,
 
I want to share my experience with one of upwork's freelancers over the last months to prevent other clients from making the same mistake. Here is what I also wrote to the upwork support:
 
 
 
Spoiler (Highlight to read)
In May 2018 two friends and I created an offer on upwork for a software development project. We wanted a piece of software that gathers information from one source, processes that and outputs automated clicks and commands in another software.
 
We quickly got a few applications from which we chose **edited for Community Guidelines** after some interviews. He offered the job for 1.000$+fees as you can also see from both of our account histories I imagine. We also agreed on how those 1.000$ would be structured: 4 steps with 250$ payments paid out at 1. Start of the project 2. Delivery of proof of concept (POC) 3. Start of acceptance testing and 4. Completion of acceptance testing and final delivery.
 
We also asked **edited for Community Guidelines** if he can sell us the source code of the finished product to which he agreed but he wanted 100% (another 1.000$) on top and he wanted payment via a different way than Upwork to circumvent fees. He convinced us that this was a fair deal and began programming.
 
With a bit of delay but after a reasonable amount of time, **edited for Community Guidelines** delivered the POC-stage of the project which looked promising. We released the second step of payments, but then the trouble began. **edited for Community Guidelines** complained that it was more work than anticipated and demanded more money. We made a step towards him and told him that we would have a follow-up project (the serverization of the current project, i.e. getting inputs from one PC, outputs on a server and then communicating those outputs back to the original PC) and would be prepared to pay more if he would do that as well.
 
At this point **edited for Community Guidelines** told us that he was already underpaid for what he had done up to that point and that he wanted all future payments via other services than Upwork, again to circumvent fees. However, he also agreed on the new project (finishing the old one and the serverization of it) for a higher price, if we would finish the Upwork project and do all future business directly. We reluctantly agreed since **edited for Community Guidelines** seemed competent and the POC looked promising.
 
So, we paid out the two last steps of the Upwork project (although we still only had the POC at that point) and even gave him a five-star-rating that he asked for (“to motivate him for the next steps of the project”). If you would like to investigate that, the requirements stated in “Roadmap 2.0” in our Upwork project are not met and you are very welcome to ask **edited for Community Guidelines** about that.
 
Instead of first finishing the old standalone-version of the project, **edited for Community Guidelines** wanted to leave that at the POC-stage and start with the serverization right away. We were again sceptical at first, but **edited for Community Guidelines** convinced us with some technical arguments which we believed, as he was the expert.
 
After quite a few weeks with various excuses by **edited for Community Guidelines**, he demonstrated a first version of the server-client-infrastructure and again wanted to be paid. At this point we had agreed on a step-by-step payment with an overall budget of 5.000$ for both projects including source code. **edited for Community Guidelines** told us that he needs to get somewhat close to his hourly rate and we paid 1.750$ for the demo-version of the server-client-infrastructure at that point (including source code), so that there was 2.250$ left in the budget for the completion of both half-finished pieces of code.
 
At this point, **edited for Community Guidelines** disappeared almost completely. Every one or two weeks he would come online and write us an E-mail or Skype message of how he is sorry, but he has “domestic issues”, “end-of-month-work to do” or that some Microsoft update broke his development software.
 
In the meantime, one of the guys in our team tried developing the project on his own, using **edited for Community Guidelines** code as the basis. He discovered that many functions that **edited for Community Guidelines** demonstrated as working logic of the program were actually just broken pieces of code that could not withstand any further testing than what **edited for Community Guidelines** demonstrated to us to fool us into believing it was working software.
 
It is hard to argue with domestic issues (I believe he even talked of his sick wife), but we got really angry when we discovered that **edited for Community Guidelines** was applying to other projects on Upwork two days ago. We confronted him, demanding an explanation and a refund for the broken pieces of software he delivered and that he clearly had no intention of finishing or fixing.
All we got were answers like:
 
**edited for Community Guidelines** (as explanation for why he put our project on hold for months while searching for other projects on Upwork. Not only did he not offer us any alternative, but he was also explicitly searching for projects with fixed price on Upwork)
**edited for Community Guidelines** (as stated above, many functions of the “deliverables” were just for “show” and demonstration purposes while not working in reality. Of course, we also paid for interim steps with the final product in mind, which he now is clearly not willing to deliver)
**edited for Community Guidelines**
 
We of course understand that you have no way of mediating or getting us a refund here as the Upwork project is officially completed and **edited for Community Guidelines** successfully screwed us by conducting all future business directly.
 
However, we would advise you strongly to prevent **edited for Community Guidelines** from applying for further work on your site and getting other customers into our situation. This really does not shed a good light on Upwork at all.
We would also like to edit our five-star rating (see above how that came about in the first place), if possible.
 
Best regards

We also asked **edited for Community Guidelines** if he can sell us the source code of the finished product to which he agreed but he wanted 100% (another 1.000$) on top and he wanted payment via a different way than Upwork to circumvent fees. He convinced us that this was a fair deal and began programming.
 
With a bit of delay but after a reasonable amount of time, **edited for Community Guidelines** delivered the POC-stage of the project which looked promising. We released the second step of payments, but then the trouble began. **edited for Community Guidelines** complained that it was more work than anticipated and demanded more money. We made a step towards him and told him that we would have a follow-up project (the serverization of the current project, i.e. getting inputs from one PC, outputs on a server and then communicating those outputs back to the original PC) and would be prepared to pay more if he would do that as well.
 
At this point **edited for Community Guidelines** told us that he was already underpaid for what he had done up to that point and that he wanted all future payments via other services than Upwork, again to circumvent fees. However, he also agreed on the new project (finishing the old one and the serverization of it) for a higher price, if we would finish the Upwork project and do all future business directly. We reluctantly agreed since **edited for Community Guidelines** seemed competent and the POC looked promising.
 
So, we paid out the two last steps of the Upwork project (although we still only had the POC at that point) and even gave him a five-star-rating that he asked for (“to motivate him for the next steps of the project”). If you would like to investigate that, the requirements stated in “Roadmap 2.0” in our Upwork project are not met and you are very welcome to ask **edited for Community Guidelines** about that.
 
Instead of first finishing the old standalone-version of the project, **edited for Community Guidelines** wanted to leave that at the POC-stage and start with the serverization right away. We were again sceptical at first, but **edited for Community Guidelines** convinced us with some technical arguments which we believed, as he was the expert.
 
After quite a few weeks with various excuses by **edited for Community Guidelines**, he demonstrated a first version of the server-client-infrastructure and again wanted to be paid. At this point we had agreed on a step-by-step payment with an overall budget of 5.000$ for both projects including source code. **edited for Community Guidelines** told us that he needs to get somewhat close to his hourly rate and we paid 1.750$ for the demo-version of the server-client-infrastructure at that point (including source code), so that there was 2.250$ left in the budget for the completion of both half-finished pieces of code.
 
At this point, **edited for Community Guidelines** disappeared almost completely. Every one or two weeks he would come online and write us an E-mail or Skype message of how he is sorry, but he has “domestic issues”, “end-of-month-work to do” or that some Microsoft update broke his development software.
 
In the meantime, one of the guys in our team tried developing the project on his own, using **edited for Community Guidelines** code as the basis. He discovered that many functions that **edited for Community Guidelines** demonstrated as working logic of the program were actually just broken pieces of code that could not withstand any further testing than what **edited for Community Guidelines** demonstrated to us to fool us into believing it was working software.
 
It is hard to argue with domestic issues (I believe he even talked of his sick wife), but we got really angry when we discovered that **edited for Community Guidelines** was applying to other projects on Upwork two days ago. We confronted him, demanding an explanation and a refund for the broken pieces of software he delivered and that he clearly had no intention of finishing or fixing.
All we got were answers like:
 
**edited for Community Guidelines** (as explanation for why he put our project on hold for months while searching for other projects on Upwork. Not only did he not offer us any alternative, but he was also explicitly searching for projects with fixed price on Upwork)
**edited for Community Guidelines** (as stated above, many functions of the “deliverables” were just for “show” and demonstration purposes while not working in reality. Of course, we also paid for interim steps with the final product in mind, which he now is clearly not willing to deliver)
**edited for Community Guidelines**
 
We of course understand that you have no way of mediating or getting us a refund here as the Upwork project is officially completed and **edited for Community Guidelines** successfully screwed us by conducting all future business directly.
 
However, we would advise you strongly to prevent **edited for Community Guidelines** from applying for further work on your site and getting other customers into our situation. This really does not shed a good light on Upwork at all.
We would also like to edit our five-star rating (see above how that came about in the first place), if possible.
 
Best regards

 
 
 
Unfortunately, according to upwork guidelines there is no way to go back and dispute payment, e.g. for step 3 and 4 of the project that were never delivered. Even the 5-star-feedback can not be cancelled.
However, it is disappointing that upwork does not seem to care the slightest about mediating this conflict. While live chatting with the support they offered a mediation ""to bring the project to an amicable end"" but after that nothing has happened since and support is just ignoring further inquiries. They do not seem to care about customers.
 
Hope you dont make the same mistake and avoid this freelancer at all costs!

	Deadlines
","May 24, 2017  12:10:31 PM","
What do the deadlines actually mean in the fixed fee contracts? The reason I ask this is because I have set deadlines in milestones and contracts and they have been completely disregarded. At first I thought it was perhaps I haven't been clear enough so I changed the job required to must be reliable, explained 3 times about deadlines, and yet here I am 3 freelancers in and not one of them can keep to a deadline. Despite the fact that all of these freelancers had good feedback. My problem is that if the deadline is missed then it holds up our process. I have people waiting for work because the first freelancer hasn't done their part. Last week I actually ended up having to do the work myself. I heard from the freelancer 5 days after the deadline where she submitted her work and requested full payment. The work she submitted is no longer of use to me 5 days later after I have done the work myself. Yet she files a complaint saying she submitted the work with full accuracy. I chased her 3 times in that intervening 5 day period. This isn't the first freelancer this has happened with either. Feeling very frustrated

	Ex-Navy Engineer in Florida turns out to be someone in Cambodia
","Aug 28, 2018  03:06:12 AM","
The William **Edited for Community Guidelines**, ex-Navy engineer, whom we hired turned out to be a Cambodian online from Cambodia who kept saying ""the project is going very well"" and ""make the milestone payment"". After the project delay which the William **Edited for Community Guidelines**explained to be due to being in Cambodia, we found the true William **Edited for Community Guidelines**in Florida with some detective work using Google. The true William **Edited for Community Guidelines**said he has 7% heart functioning left due to a heart attack and he is working with a partner. The William **Edited for Community Guidelines**of Cambodia also said he had a heart attack and that was the reason for his poor job rating of 71% at UPWORK when we hired him at first. After 2 weeks of delay, during which we offered our carrier account and was told four times ""the working sample will be shipped tomorrow"", the William **Edited for Community Guidelines**finally shipped a box today via EMS from Cambodia which will take another 30 - 45 days to arrive here in US according to UPWORK. We do not know what is in the box. UPWORK clarified to us that it is not responsible for the $3005 milestone payments which we made to the William **Edited for Community Guidelines**. We need to spend another cost of Arbitration which will result in no refund if the William **Edited for Community Guidelines**does not cooperate to return the money. UPWORK promises that it will hold the UPWORK account of the William **Edited for Community Guidelines**in suspension until the refund is made, if the arbitration is in our favor. We do not think that the William **Edited for Community Guidelines**will be convinced of refunding due to the account being suspended. The damage to us could have been less at $2005 if our last payment $1000, which was on a 5 days hold at the time of our reporting the sham to UPWORK, was blocked by UPWORK. But UPWORK would do no such thing, even at our repeated request. This has been our first and very disappointing experience. It wasted our money and our time.

The contract we agreed upon was for $168 for products to be filled in my website.  She asked for $100 but she only did 5% of the work.  She needed it to pay her ""bills"". 
 
She finished the other 5% of the work and asked for the last remaining balance.  We're now disputing this and it's starting to become a problem.  Now, I'm behind and currently looking for a reliable freelancer to help me finish this task.

	Do you think that submitting work is too confusing for the clients?
","Sep 26, 2018  04:27:51 AM","
Hello all! My name is Konstantinos. I have encountered a problem with a couple of freelancers that has to do with Upwork's design of submitting work. Basically, when you submit work to the client to ask for payment, a lot of them are confused about where the documents are and they ask you to send them again. That happens because the client has to click on ""view details"" under the message to view the documents and download them. I'm not saying that this is too confusing and hard for anyone to figure out, but there are a lot of clients who struggle with that and I thought it was important to bring it up. Can I suggest that it would be more obvious if the documents would be available for download under the message like when you share links when you message them? What made me post this thread is my total amazement of a long-term client's struggle who was unable to learn how this works after I showed them too many times. Of course, they obviously just don't want to pay attention but maybe Upwork could help us freelancers with these people. Thank you for reading.

	Why is Upwork not enforcing when individuals are sharing an account?
","Sep 11, 2018  01:10:33 PM","
I have used upwork and formerly elance for over a decade and never had a major problem wtih a freelancer (in fact I have a perfect rating from freelancers).  However, I had a website project and my freelancer had a death in the family, sadly, so he was not able to complete the project. I was in a rush to get it done for the client so had to hire someone to do that last 10% of the website, a list of about 5 things.  I hired (or thought I did) a woman whose profile indicated she had almost 10 years of wordpress development experience, was a theme developer, etc.  Well, the person started and appeared to be a total Wordpress beginning, didn't even understand the platform.  It appeared that the job was handed over to someone else after the initial proposal and emails (asking for more money, which I agreed to).  After  a few hours or work this person claimed to finished and nothing was even complete, and they had now created display problems on the site. They also did things I didn't ask for , like removing plug ins or adding some, which is dangerous.  I asked to end the project.  Now they are disputing it. I looked through old reviews and saw that multiple names were used, which to me shows more than one person is working on this individual profile.  In the dispute, however, Upwork however is siding with the freelancer.  The dispute rep even called this person him at times and her at other times.  It appears that everyone but me the client knows this is a shared profile.  I am getting pressured to pay the whole amount instead of part (I offered $35 out of $200).  It is clear that nothing was completed since I immediatey opened a job with the same scope of services plus additional to correct the new problems this person caused, but Upwork is continuing to back this freelancer and is not enforcing their own TOS.   As a result, I'm sure this school or whatever it is will go on to damage other client websites.  This is not good.  Anyone else experience this?  Upwork, is this really your policy to allow this and turn a blind eye?

	Work Was Copied, Verbatim, by Freelancer **Edited for community guidelines**
","Sep 21, 2018  11:22:21 AM","
A copy of weeks ago, I had requested an ebook be written by a writer here, **Edited for community guidelines**.  She sent the file to me (it needed some revisions) and when I read it, I learned that much of the content was copied from a book already published on Amazon.  This is plagiarism, correct?
 
I immediately contacted Upwork and submitted proof.  One week later, Upwork decided to give her a courtesy credit.  She was NOT penalized at all for this inappropriate action from this platform.  WHY???!!!  It seems that the only thing of interest here is for this platform to make money, and Clients are not protected because these writers who copy other author's work, do NOT get penalized or removed from working here.
 
I was disgusted and appalled to find this out.  It is unfair to other writers here and certainly unfair to me (as a client)!
 
I emailed her questioning this but she never replied.  The ""team"" closed the contract and now I am not able to leave public feedback.  I know they can reverse this and allow me to leave feedback but I was told they cannot.  So disappointed with upwork.  I will stick with the other, reputable platform who takes an interest in buyers and sellers alike.

	Charged for hourly work not related to contract?
","Sep 18, 2018  09:30:35 PM","
This is my first hourly contract. When I reviewed the work diary I saw many instances of being charged but the attached images had nothing to do with the contract. Such as emailing another client about their contract, looking up random stuff on the internet, checking emails (that weren't mine), looking at his job feed, etc. I sent him a message about it yesterday and he never responded. This is a highly reviewed freelancer with a lot of hours logged working on this platform so I don't want to jump to conclusions. Anyone else have this issue before?

	Please disclose your fees
","Sep 16, 2018  03:27:45 PM","
Hi. I don't have any problem with your fee structure.In fact, they're fine. But I do have a problem with the fact that they don't seem to be disclosed up front. I sent the escrow funds for the 1st phase of a small project: $100.I would swear that when I went to PayPal, it said $100.(It's possible I didn't look closely enough.)So I recorded $100 in my register. When I saw the email'd receipt, it was for $102.75.Again, I'm fine with the amount, and the illustrator I connected with stellar.But when I was sending funds, I remember wondering: How do you guys get paid?I had thought it would be me, but nothing in the checkout process alerted me to that fact. I'd like to know what I'm paying, if only to put the proper amount into my register,preferably before seeing the receipt.

	Fraudulent Claim

Hi
 
A freelancer did not obtain my authorization before new worksheet was created and Upwork did not request for my authorisation before fund was released. The freelancer did nothing for the money claimed. Please i need this money back
 
Freelancer:  **Edited for Community Guidelines**
Invoice #:  **Edited for Community Guidelines**
Amount: $70.00
 
I also believe this freelancer is a fraudster. Her initial name was Kim and later changed to Shamsun. Initial profile picture was a white lady who claimed to be from USA. Few weeks ago, the profile picture changed to an Asian looking woman.I would appreciate if your team act quickly on this matter to ensure your other users dont fall victim like meAny assistant offered to recover all my money back ASAP would be greatly appreciated

	What is the best way to modify a contract
","Sep 16, 2018  08:52:49 PM","
Hi. My illustrator is doing wonderful work, and she's great to work with.But the scope of the job has expanded, so I need to increase thefee, add a milestone for the additional work, and adjust the existingmilestones to reflect what we're actually doing. What is the best way to do that? At the moment I'm thinking:Create a new contract for the 3rd milestone and the additional fee.Make payments on the first two milestones as we've recently agreed,and ignore their current descriptions. That will work, but it would be nice if the revised contract were a better reflection of the work performed.

	Review Extortion and Blackmail Determined to be an Acceptable Practice by Upwork
","Aug 31, 2018  09:04:06 AM","
This is important for all Upwork users to be aware of before engaging in any work on Upwork and before giving your hard earned dollars to this organization:
 
I had a freelancer develop a website for me.  He was paid over $9,000 and I gave him 5 star reviews.  He did more work for me later but became unresponsive on numerous issues and so I ended the last contract and rated him a 3.75 stars due to a 0 star for communication and 5 star on everything else.
 
Turns out, the code he used for a part of my website was stolen and was malfunctioning.  No one can provide support for stollen code so I asked the freelancer to fix his work. He said he would not help me becuase I gave him a bad review (3.75 stars).  He said the only way he would fix his own work in this area would be if I can get Upwork to allow me to raise my review on him.  But without that, he won't help (see attachment).  This is extortion, i.e. refusing to take any type of action unless you give a high review. He would have been fine to just have told me, ""no, I won't do it."" He would be within his rights.  But when he tells me he won't do it unless I give him a good review, that's extortion, and it hurts the integrity of the review process on Upwork that so many people depend on.
 
This correspondence was all done on Upwork messaging and I sent those screenshots of his conduct to Upwork security, along with Shopify stating that he stole code and that they couldn't help me.  Upwork security told me they will take no action. 
 
So, Upwork has determined that review extortion is an acceptable practice on Upwork.
 
After knowing this, how can any customer feel comfortable giving a review of anything less than 5 stars knowing that the freelancer can then extort you for that later. Also, how can anyone take the reviews of a freelancer seriously knowing that they can work the Upwork system and extort their way to high ratings<
 
I have asked security for Upwork's policy on review extortion and they have not provided it yet.  I'm still waiting.  But it appears clear that Upwork has no policy on review extortion, and is also completely fine with it.  So now I have to try and find a way to reopen my review of this freelancer so I can give him a 5 star review so he'll fix my website.  And unfortunately, all other potential customers out there will not know who this guy really is and become victims themselves later.
 
Very sad and scary, Upwork.

	If Upwork facilitates paying Bonuses, why not a system for penalties too ?
","Sep 1, 2018  06:48:14 AM","
We've been on Upwork more than 2 years now, and have multiple jobs going on at any particular time. We've had a fair share of Freelancers work with us ; story-writers, engineers, artists, modelers and testers, from all over the world. Almost all our projects are fixed-price projects. In 80% of our projects, schedules are always met.  And we pay Bonuses to those freelancers who go ""beyond the call of duty"".  There are the balance projects where it becomes frustrating having to wait on a Freelancer, whose deliverables are dependencies for others. Why can't a formal Penalty & Bonus clause be enabled in the Contracts?  With reminders to Freelancers about ucoming due dates, to motivate them to complete.  Freelancers could even earn Upwork Badges for ahead of time Jobs they complete, or Bonuses earned.   These Bonuses & Penalties should be outside the purview of Upwork commissions. Until it becomes as part of the Upwork workflow, has anyone experience with incorporating Penalties in their agreements ?   Any advice on how to get freelancers who deliver on time, or most effective means to get them to ?

 We are trying to figure out the best way to post a specific job and looking for input regarding assistance on a new business book regarding commercial real estate.  The author has already written and self-published 3 books previously including one best-seller on Amazon.  He has started to write his forth but is having trouble finding the time and we’d like to have it out quicker than he can do it.  It will be just under 200 pages.  We need some input/options on the most efficient and effective way to proceed. We’re thinking he could give a ghostwriter what he has already, have a conversation (in person or via zoom) to get the tone and to outline the remainder of the book and then let them finish it.  Or he could record most of the content and his thoughts, have it transcribed and then have a conversation and allow the ghostwriter to complete it.   Or how else would we proceed? And how would we estimate time and cost for such a project?  It’s important that we maintain his writing style. Thank you!

","Aug 30, 2018  11:29:43 AM","
I posted on 8/28 Tuesday my experince of hiring someone through UPWORK which turned out to be a disaster. But I cannot find the post now unless by search word. I thought the posts are listed in chronological order?  I am posting it again. The William **Edited for Community Guidelines**, ex-Navy engineer, whom we hired turned out to be a Cambodian online from Cambodia who kept saying ""the project is going very well"" and ""make the milestone payment"". After the project delay which the William **Edited for Community Guidelines**explained to be due to being in Cambodia, we found the true William **Edited for Community Guidelines**in Florida with some detective work using Google. The true William **Edited for Community Guidelines**said he has 7% heart functioning left due to a heart attack and he is working with a partner. The William **Edited for Community Guidelines**of Cambodia also said he had a heart attack and that was the reason for his poor job rating of 71% at UPWORK when we hired him at first. After 2 weeks of delay, during which we offered our carrier account and was told four times ""the working sample will be shipped tomorrow"", the William **Edited for Community Guidelines**finally shipped a box today via EMS from Cambodia which will take another 30 - 45 days to arrive here in US according to UPWORK. We do not know what is in the box. UPWORK clarified to us that it is not responsible for the $3005 milestone payments which we made to the William **Edited for Community Guidelines**. We need to spend another cost of Arbitration which will result in no refund if the William **Edited for Community Guidelines**does not cooperate to return the money. UPWORK promises that it will hold the UPWORK account of the William **Edited for Community Guidelines**in suspension until the refund is made, if the arbitration is in our favor. We do not think that the William **Edited for Community Guidelines**will be convinced of refunding due to the account being suspended. The damage to us could have been less at $2005 if our last payment $1000, which was on a 5 days hold at the time of our reporting the sham to UPWORK, was blocked by UPWORK. But UPWORK would do no such thing, even at our repeated request. This has been our first and very disappointing experience. It wasted our money and our time.

I want to pay him for the amount of work he did but all I see on the contract pay page is a green ""pay"" button. I had read earlier that I should be able to select the ""pay"" button but I get to another ""pay"" button... My question is: Is there another window after the 2nd ""pay"" button to specify how much money to pay out to the freelancer? I really don't want to pay the full amount.I look forward to responses & I thank you in advance for your help! Bret

	Alert - Constant over-billing by Upwork !
","Apr 4, 2017  12:15:53 AM","
Upwork uses 10-minute billing segments, and so it constantly rounds up the time in favor of the freelancers.This means that if a freelancer works from 15:09 to 12:21, although he worked 12 minutes, Upwork consider it as if he worked 30 min!!And so, if a freelancer works 10 hours net a day, but makes 20 breaks (which is legitimate) and he does so everytime he works from 00h:09m to 00h:31m, and he earns $50/h, the employer losses almost 40% (few hundred dollars!!) . This number can be increased if he makes more breaks.We addressed Upwork and got an ambiguous answer that if there will change the policy, all will be notified.This method is, of course, not used in other similar sites.We clarified to Upwork that we will not work with them until this is changed/fixed.I highly recommend that you follow us and do the same.Regards

	Client Dispute and Potential Arbitration
","Aug 17, 2018  12:17:11 PM","
Hey Fellow Freelancers, I recently engaged in a copywriting project for a London based consultancy, but it didn't end well. I delivered the first draft a day ahead of schedule. The following day, I had client meetings outside of Berlin, so I was offline during working hours. By the time I had logged back in, the client had cancelled the contract and requested a refund. Bear in mind at this point I had already written five 600 word flyers for him. He asked for some edits which I would have happily and easily executed for him, within hours and still way ahead of the agreed deadline.  During Upwork's dispute resolution, he offered me $50, now its down to $30. He must think freelancers on Upwork enjoy working for nothing, the kind souls that we are. I feel there is a power dynamic in favour of clients on this site, as we are desperate to protect our feedback score and of course our income. This gives clients the impression that they can demand the world for what is mostly very poor pay. Here are the figures:Amount in Escrow $175Charge for both parties and Upwork to enter a 3rd party arbitration - $291 per person.Moral victory for hard-working, poorly paid freelancers - priceless?

	No support to clients
","Aug 17, 2018  01:11:32 AM","
Upwork mediation team does not provide any support to clients in the event of a dispute. After numerous complaints about a freelancer I agreed to go into mediation as the freelancer refused to refund me for the sub-standard work. We both agreed to continue to work together to fix the work but she went AWOL. I notified the Upwork mediation team several times about this but I got no assistance.
 
I decided to move on and find someone else to fix the work and now the freelancer refuses to transfer the work I paid for to my server unless I close the dispute I have with her. This is outright blackmail. I am shocked that such behaviour from freelancers is not corrected by Upwork because such freelancers continue to be ""top-rated"" while we as clients get terrible reviews from them. 
 
What is my recourse now?

	Milestones - client delayed approval
","Aug 13, 2018  10:29:10 AM","
Hi there,I'm working on a project right now that has four milestones. I had set the proposed deadlines for each milestone, which the client used to create the contract. I submitted the first milestone ahead of schedule and my client let me know that they had some personal matters come up and might be delayed in reviewing/approving the first milestone. 10 days later, the first milestone still hasn't been reviewed or approved. The deadline for the second milestone has now passed, but of course I can't start or submit the work until the first milestone is approved. Will missing the second milestone deadline affect my job success score, even though it's because the client hasn't had the time to review/approve the first milestone? Is there a way to adjust the deadlines for future milestones (previously, they were set assuming that the client would be reviewing/approving in a timely manner)? Note: all communication with the client has been good. I know that they delay is only because they have had personal matters come up.  Thanks very much!

	URGENT HELP - Are UpWork freelancers an employee or a contractor according to UK employment law?
","Aug 10, 2018  04:25:08 AM","
Hello Everyone, I need some urgent help from everyone or someone who knows about employment law and how it relates to using freelancers on UpWork in relation to the UK.  I need an accurate answer to this, rather than vague ones, please. If I hire freelancers through UpWork, and they work regularly for my company (UK limited company), for example, 10-40 hours per week on a shift basis, and let us assume they help my customers (customer service) and do some admin. Are they then considered an employee of my company in terms of the law (UK)? Or does UpWork act like a recruitment agency, so in effect the the ""freelancer"" has a direct contract with UpWork, and not with my company, and UpWork has a contract with my company to invoice me for the hours done by the freelancer, so in effect its not an employee-employer relationship, but a ""contractor"" who invoices my company for placing staff or for getting work done. I know a lot of local recruitment agencies in the UK do the latter, however, I do not know if the same rules apply to a service like Upwork. This is an extremely important question for us, and most likely for many UK businesses. We are thinking of expanding our use of UpWork, but it is important that we stay within the UK law with regards to who is an employee and who is a contractor/freelancer. And the answer to this affects things for us. Please help with an answer if you can. Thank you so much. Kind regards, Ryan

	Fake spam freelancers everywhere
","May 17, 2018  09:32:11 AM","
I have been using Upwork, with good results for over a year. However, I recently posted a project looking for some React.js developers. Unfortunately we have been inundated with spam/ fake accounts - something i didn't think happened on Upwork. I had a shortlist of 10 -12 finalised for Skype interviews. After the first 3 I realised that not only did the freelancers not seem to be aware of their own work history or skillsets correctly, as they had described them, but they all had asian accents, despite preporting to be from European countries. I don't care what country someone is from - but i do care about them telling the truth about it. Out of the remaining 8 candidates i asked them all to make sure they have a webcam that they can use for the conversation. Only 2 of them would agree. The rest of them all pulled out of having a quick skype conversation if a webcam had been used. After going back through all the profiles i noticed a similar pattern to the ones that pulled out. None could be found on linked in, All had similarly vague education history, and all of them have started since roughly january '18. They were all European identities, a majority also had a lot of jobs done but all for seemingly random, low amounts - e.g. 10 projects complete but fo $50-$100 dollars each - so that their work history looks good and they have lots of proejcts with 5 stars until you actually examine the projects. They all also had big projects for large amounts - that were all still open. making their accounts look like they have done a lot of work.  My guess is the same guys that are creating fictitious western identies are also creating fictitious client accounts to juice up their stats and numbers to seem legit. I'm sure some of them are good coders - but are you really going to trust someone to work on your code who is telling you they are a completely different person from a totally different country? This has been an incredibly frustrating process and wasted 3-4 days of time between organising and tyring to interview these candidates. I really hope Upwork will take note of this and try to improve this spam or it will become an unusable platform. I'd advise all clients to throw the question out there next time they are hiring - can the freelancer have a skype/ upwork conversation using a  webcam. I think you will be surprised by how many candidates will drop out at this suggestion. These fake accounts do no favours for real freelancers as i've been left totally paranoid now about who it is I am hiring on the service.

Hi everyone. I am new to this platform. I created my first job post and funded the project with my CC. I received like 5-6 applications from freelancers.

I ended the contract.I then rehired the the original developer to fix the site, which he did. All of the work the freelancer did was deleted ! Now It looks like I need to go through Abitration , Should I ??? If I let the freelancer off and pay him I am sure he will do this again to another person  !This freelancer has a 5.6 rating and has had other problems with clients but I thought I could trust him after many conversations , I was wrong. He also Lied about his location saying he was from Sydney , Australia but actually from Nairobi , Kenya , His IP address says Kenya and after I called him out one hour later he changed his bio to Kenya.

Dear clients, I just scanned through approximately 10 hours of your RFPs in Writing and Translating. If you are receiving nothing but gibberish, bot bids, or ""I can do that"" responses... the problem lies with you in the main.No freelancer with an ounce of talent, brains, or common sense will bid on your job without two essential elements. 1. Genre /nature /overall topic2. Venue in which your need will be used - website, brochure, ebook, etc.  By my unofficial tally about 1 job posted out of 25 contained some semblance of these 2 basics.

	Freelancer Requesting Payment for Incomplete work
","Jul 27, 2018  04:13:28 AM","
Some advice needed. I hired a guy to build two apps (ios and android) and a website, that all work together. We agreed on milestones and payment.  The first milestone was design- that phase is complete and payment was released. The second milestone is to be released on completion of the build.We are now one month passed the initial dealinethe website has not been startedthe ios app is barely startedthe android app is one third built, but not functional as many features do not work as discussed This is obviously a very large and expensive milestone Problem i have is that the freelancer keeps requesting that I release partial payment, he sends me messages about how he has a family to support and bills to pay and says today that without partial payment there will be more delays in the work. I am not comfortable paying for something that is not complete and does not work. he may have done some work on the project already- but there is nothing that i can do with a half-built app. i will not be able to take it to another developer to complete, i would have to start from scratch. so i am scared that this is a scam and the freelancer cannot infact deliver what he has promised and he is trying to squeeze some extra last cash out of me before he dissappears. Thoughts?

In addition to being a Client on Upwork for many years and hiring many people, I recently signed up to be a Freelancer and have completed some successful jobs.  I noticed today that my CLIENT profile says ""2.5 of 8 reviews"" and shows 2.5 stars when one of my CLIENT job postings showed up in my FREELANCER searches.  However, of the 17 jobs I have hired for on Upwork since 2014 my start rating is clearly 4-5 stars based on the reviews I have received. How is my client rating 2.5 when my job rating is over 4?  What is causing this?  How is this scored? I don't want freelancers to see this low score and not want to work with me.  I have had many freelancers and paid well and done well on Upwork and would really like to know why this is and what to do about it. Is it because I post jobs sometimes and cancel before hiring?  Because I keep contracts open with some freelancers who I use on an as needed basis? Why? Any input appreciated.

	Ridiculous - Cannot Specify Country for Required Applicants
","Jul 23, 2018  06:06:41 AM","
Why is Upwork so out of touch with the needs of its users? Ever since Elance migrated into Upwork, its always felt as though the features and the ""logic"" of Upwork is based on people who don't actually understand the needs of the user base. Developers building and maintaining a platform without actually understanding how it needs to be used. As an example I'm a UK freelancer, i do freelance work for a company in Iceland and that company has a warehouse in the United States. We need to specifically higher someone from the United States for a project however as the business is based in Iceland there is no way to do this. I'm currently having to wade through applications from everywhere BUT the United States - what a waste of time.It's ridiculous given this site should understand that many freelancers are mobile workers and many people are looking for a specific set of skills from a specific country. If i want someone to do translaction work i'd likely want someone from Spain... yet the stupidity of Upwork simply wouldn't allow it i would presume based on the fact that the business is still based in Iceland. Come on Upwork - start actually talking and listening to your user base rather than just ""presuming"" you know what is best, as quite clearly, you haven't got a clue.  Rant over!

	Evidence of UpWork supporting Scam freelancers in order to get they commissions
","Jul 20, 2018  12:20:07 PM","
following I’ll show you that UpWork supporting Scam freelancers in order to get them commissions we had a dispute case opened in order to get the funds back from escarole because the freelancer failed to provide requested task.As requested we have been replying to each case in the ""Dispute are"" where you can only respond to a new case without having option to choose or to ad additional information to already responded messagesToday 20.07.2018 at 6:56 AM we got mail saying; ""As you remain unresponsive to mediation, the funds in escrow have been released to the freelancer and this case is closed."" When you have a case in Dispute are or when you have upwork representative contacting you by mail there is no explanation or guide that explaining or notifying you about, how/where you should respond to dispute case.Now appears that you should respond to each ticket separately and it doesn’t matter if you responded from Dispute area, Upwork just doesn’t care or either read your Dispute case, they only want to get them commissions from the funds sent to freelancer. That’s all mean that Upwork is not a neutral market place as their interest is from amount of funds relist to freelancer When upwork notifies you about dispute it says: ""If agreement cannot be reached within five business days, the dispute can be escalated to an independent arbitrator.""-- Dispute ID 10xxx02x created on Jul 7 - today Jul 20 = Upwork doesn't support its own rules we applied a question to upwork support asking how to take this case to arbitrage court where a third person will judge our case on which the answer was ""I'm so sorry, but the dispute case is closed. It's no longer eligible for arbitration"" We are not been responsive or we have no rights in our case

	Suddenly no response from Freelancer company
","Jul 12, 2018  02:04:33 AM","
Hi guys ...
 
We have been doing business with **Edited for Community Guidelines**for a mobile app, for quite some time, and it was been growing step by step. We have a fixed contract and already transferred around 90% (equals > 10'000 USD) of the overall ammount. 
Now we wanted to rollout the first versoin on our own servers ... and suddenly we get no feedback from them since 2 weeks. Actually its around 2 month at the moment, but they showed some signs of life for a short time ""we get back to you shortly""... without any action though ...
 
It is so sad, since the project is nearly finished ... but now ... it feels like a strike. Our main communication is through skype ... but as mentioned ... no feedback at all. 
I wonder also why, because we are dealing with a freelancer company - who is rated quite good here.
 
What would you recommend to do?
 
Is there a way to give out a ""warning"" / or request for action through upwork?
 
We certainly want to finish the project ... but how can we do that without any feedabck from their side. 
 
It is possible to hand over an unfinished project to another feelancer?
Since it is hard to judge the quality of the code (lets consider the project as a prototype) - I do not know if that would be such an easy task.
 
Kind regards
Marcel

I paid for some completed work on Jun 25, 2018. The amount was marked as returned on my Upwork account on Jun 30, 2018. The subcontractor claims he hasn't been paid due to his account being blocked.The creditcard company told me that the transaction was pending and I had to wait for my statement to know for sure if the payment was going through or not. I've got my statement today and the payment has now gone through. I checked my Upwork account and it is in credit by the amount I have paid. Can I get a refund for the credit on my upwork account or should I ask the creditcard company to issue a chargeback?

	Best practice for building web application w/ developers via Upwork?
","Jul 9, 2018  05:40:22 PM","
Hi Everyone, I'm new to Upwork and would like to see if anyone has an inside scoop on what is best practice for hiring, working with, and paying remote developers here on projects with complex specifications, such as web applications (not your ordinary kind of websites).  It's very much a from-scratch project with a decent number of features for a small/medium-sized web app.  What I am most concerned about is quality of work, communication, timely turnarounds, team work, issuing reasonable payments, and having my expectations met.  Do you break the work up into parts or multiple projects?  Is it too demanding to request daily updates from developers if using milestone payment schedule?  Do you hire multiple developers here to collaborate on the same project or utilize code review?  Are you able to use Agile/Scrum methodology with remote developers?  And does Agile mix well with milestone payments for your developers? I'd love to know what has worked for you. Thanks,Richard

Mentioning a website in a message with a freelancer automatically inserts a snippet of additional content into the message. This clutters up the messages and conversation.  It can confuse both me and the freelancer I'm sending the message to as they are reading something I didn't write and also makes it hard to re-read the whole conversation. How can I prevent this from happening?

	Financial transactions for Gregory Kennedy (21828473) have been limited.  PayPal fixed in 15 mins.
","Jul 6, 2018  02:19:38 PM","
Financial transactions for Gregory **edited for Community Guidelines** (21828473) have been limited.  PayPal fixed in 15 mins.  I am the co-founder along with Hollywood Emmy award winner Noam Dromi.  I logged into PayPal from New Jersey / New York where I am working on our business.  I usually log in from Hollywood so PayPal sent us a security alert which was fixed within 15 minutes. Apparently, Upwork platform did not receive the update that all was fine after this.
 
That we have to go to a community page first when responding to an alert message from your platform about payment, instead of directly to customer service delayed us hiring the developer until Monday.   Time-consuming and not very professional.  We are hiring the dev on Monday through Upwork and hopefully, our experience with Upwork will be smooth and professional.
 
Thank you,

	Appropriate to pay freelancer for sample in proposal?
","Jul 5, 2018  05:49:40 AM","
I posted a job for logo work. One application contained a rough sample with an idea that I really liked, but the freelancers style and portfolio weren't a good fit. The text of the job ad asked for text ideas, not samples, but the visual is what made me think it was a good idea even if it only forms the beginning of the process. If the submission had contained only text, I would not feel any obligation even if another freelancer executed something directly from it, but the fact that the end result will be visually similiar makes it feel different somehow. What I would like to do is offer the freelancer who submitted the sample a % of the contract total as a thank you, but I don't see any way to do that without creating a job just for the purpose of sending money his way. What would you do in this situation?

So there is this men called **Edited for community guidelines** (from Singapore). He created a 3500-words general translation proposal to which I had happily responded yesterday.

I have checked Upwork terms and found out that it is allowed at our own risk (as long as no personal information is given) so I agreed. 
 
Turns out this men is a developer from Upwork whose account was closed (and creating a new one didn't help him cause he kept getting blocked). All he wanted was to «cooperate» with me by using my account and Teamviewer or something. 
 
I am only starting out here on Upwork and trying to use my chances. I was hoping for an honest cooperation and finally becoming a reliable contractor but all I did was waste my time. I don't even know whether I am more shocked or dissapointed right now.

It certainly ticked alll my boxes. He looked through my  job proposal and he advised it was slightly over budget so I planned for it to start again in 6 months when I have organised a bigger buget. He was very helpful to advise. He picked trough the brief to see what he could do under the budget and did about 8hours and I was very happy with his work and l Ieft 5 stared feed back and had plans to work with him again bearing in mind he has worked on the project and now has knowledge of which I've paid for. Soooooooo what could go wrong?

	Payment weswap
","Jun 30, 2018  07:30:08 AM","
Hi, I am trying to understand the most cost effective way to pay a freelancer i am planning to hire. The price qouted to me is 1200usd (600 upfront and 600 after the job compleation). After reading the documentation I realied that $25 flat fee is best for me. It says a credit/debit card that is billed in your local currency is required. I have a local credit card in gbp which i think should work straighway. However, i wonder, if i will be able to pay using a weswap mastercard in which i hold deposit in both currencies inclding usd as well as in gbp? Also, lets say if i am paying in usd using my weswap mastercard, then would i still need to pay this $25 fee?  Many thanks

	Client <> Freelancer Relationship: Who owns the materials?
","Jun 29, 2018  06:37:39 AM","
Hello,I am new to UpWork and had a very specific question about the Client <> Freelancer relationship. Specifically in regards to who owns the materials of the work and where the lines start/end. I am not in the middle of a dispute yet. I just want to make sure that I have all my bases covered and am reaching out to ask if I need a separate agreement with the freelancer that I hire to cover this.I have posted my first job where I need a freelancer to help pick the font, color, size, shape, etc of the text for my company name which will be shown with my company logo. Does the Client, Freelancer, or both own the material once the job has been completed? How about if the job is commissioned but never completed (I am assuming in this case the Freelancer owns the materials)? What about if all of the other samples that are created once a contract is in place and successfully completed (Does the Client own all the samples as well?)?Thanks for your help in advance!

	Hate the policy of not letting use payoneer cards even for One time projects Escrow
","Jun 28, 2018  10:51:05 PM","
I have been a client on elance foor over 3 years, and then forced to move to upwork.  I live in pakistan where it is really hard for an 20 year old to get credit cards and even harder to get online transactions as banks systems are not good at all. Nevertheless my lifeline has been Payoneer card and since last year upwork stopped accepting payoneer cards for projects.  Now I have a project stuck since one year, I have finally got one card from a Pakistani bank only to come to know later that bank's system doesn't let transactions to happen from website stored card info. The whole system has become a choas , a humble request. Kindly can you please allow us to hire freelancers with payoneer cards at least for one time projects when whole money is escrowed even before the work starts?Thank u

	Unable to add a new billing method
","Jun 28, 2018  01:01:55 PM","
Hello,I have a client account on Upwork with good standing and as of recently, I'm having trouble to add my Visa card as a new billing method.I have contacted the bank and they see that Upwork system keeps attempting to send the wrong type of request meant for credit cards, while the card I want to add is moto/ecommerce debit card. I have enough funds on the account to pass the verification process, but I've been informed by the bank that there hasn't even been an attempt to charge the card. Upwork simply sends request for the wrong type of card, which is rejected and charging isn't even attempted. The type of request sent is for credit cards only and ends immediately with error 05 after the first attempt, while it should also need to send the second one that would allow verification of debit type of cards as well. My issue is that I have been using this same type of card without any issues until it recently expired and my now trying to add a new one without success.I have contacted support over this many times and haven't managed to get connected to someone who would give me the solution other than 'Contact your bank, we get error 05, it's at their end', while it most certainly isn't.Changing the bank after using it for so long and after having so many interlinked accounts on it is simply the last option I would like to use.I would appreciate the input from the community - have you encountered the similar problem and whether and how you managed to solve it?Thank you in advance.

	Copyright Ownership In a Partial Project
","Jun 26, 2018  09:27:23 AM","
Hi, Going through a particular case of copyright ownership, and was looking for opinions. I wrote a White Paper for a client. Payment was structured 50% up-front, 40% after first revision phase and 10% on final clean-up.Up-front payment was made to start the project.I handed in the first draft, and waited for feedback. There was some back and forth, and discussions about the person responsible for review being unreachable.After 120+ days, the project was closed by error, and the escrow for the 50% remaining refunded to the client. My question: Do I own the copyright on the first draft I wrote? Because right now, I did receive some funds, and the project is listed as complete on Upworks, but I certainly did not get paid the full agreed ammount. Thanks Jean-Francois

	Petty Cash Account for Virtual Assistant
","Jun 25, 2018  06:16:42 AM","
I have been working with virtual assistants for some years now, and think it would be enormously helpful to be able to create a petty cash account from which my trusted VA could draw as needed to address tasks I assign her.  It is risky and complicated to add and remove people from my company (or personal) bank accounts, and tricky to get credit or debit cards for foreign VAs.  A far simpler idea would be to have Upwork offer such a service! This could be another way to keep Upwork curtomers working within the Upwork framework. It would provide a potential source of fee-based income for Upwork. And it would be hugely helpful to me.  I am imagining a limited fund of about $10 - $100 that I could put aside as a deposit to an Upwork account, that my VA could draw from each week. I see no significant risk, since I already use Upwork to manage payments to my VA. I would simply add this feature at some percent or fee-based cost. As far as I am concerned, Upwork could take the money out as it does with my weekly payment, OR you could require an advance deposit each week. Both are done now with employees, and either would be reasonable from a user's perspective for a petty cash fund.

None of them have local number, and don't speak Russian or Spanish, after short conversation they told a similar story about how they migrated to China, and that their monther is Chinese. Should I every interview start from asking if the candidate is from China? Can someone advice a strategy to avoid this?
