Hi, maybe someone here can help.I can't use my account anymore, because it saysFinancial transactions for your company have been limited. and though I can't post a new job.

	Freelancer outsourced the job to someone else? (to a non english speaker, work terrible) money lost?
","May 7, 2021  11:58:14 PM","
Hi. I am having a lot of issues at the moment with some work that recently got 'completed'. I am in disbelief at how this has been handled so far. I paid an individual freelancer $400 to complete a webpage. I left instructions and videos on what was required. The work was 'completed' numerous times. But ridden with errors every time. It was taking me longer to find and correct the careless errors than it would've done to complete the work myself.It turns out the freelancer has outsourced the work to non-English speakers that had a hard time reading and implementing what was required.A month late we still don't have a finished product, and the freelancer outsourced the work wasting time and energy.Now with the dispute... I have been told that I need to spend $300 for arbitration to have a 'chance' of getting my money back? Spending an additional $300 to get back the $400? This is absurd. The freelancer was a month late, outsourced the work, didn't complete the work and wants full payments plus I have to pay an additional $300 to challenge this? What is the best option here, I cannot believe this whole situation. Freelancer clearly violated TOS by outsourcing right? Plus the work is incomplete after me spending hours on revisions guidance etc. Would love to hear your thoughts.

	Freelancer performance claims and guarantees - TOS
","May 10, 2021  10:15:47 PM","
Wondering if anyone can point me to the section of the TOC the may deal with advertised performance guarnatees.  We have recently had a problem with a freelancer/agency who clearly advertising a performance guarantee or refund of paid fees. I confirmed this with the freelancer prior to starting the contract and have excalated to upwork support. Currently its an ongoing mediation process.  But I would have to assume that freelancer would be subject to certain terms of service with respect to what they advertise on their profiles and the claims they make to obtain contracts.  If not what would be the best course of action or recourse to deal with this specific situation.  bottom line freelancer made claims based on performance, and confirmed the refund policy in messages. Could not execute and provide the results and not is refusing to honor the guarnatee.  Very frusterating experience so far, i;m sure this is a one off. But either way i'd like to deal with this promptly.  Tahank you in advance for any advise that you can provde,

	Calling all MUSIC clients! (Some advice.)
","Jan 12, 2020  08:16:04 PM","
I'm just gonna be straightforward, and hopefully UpWork doesn't take this down. 
 
Some of us out here work in the music industry. We are basically on UpWork to fill in the ""gaps"" during certain seasons or to rack up a savings in a short time. Whatever the reason, we are HERE.
 
**edited for Community Guidelines**
 
Here's how you can help yourselves: 

Provide - in your job/task description - your artist name, band name, stage name (whatever the case may be...) so we can check you out. Don't worry - we'll make our way back here to UpWork for pay and parameters (TRUST me, because we want the protection too!). But, I can't tell you how many times I've submitted a proposal for an artist who later turned out to be not my niche genre. YES, that matters in terms of integrity and doing YOU justice. For instance, I only do pop, pop/hip-hop...and I dabble in pop/rap and a tiny bit of pop/EDM. YOU DON'T WANT ME REPPING YOUR COUNTRY BRAND, then...now do you? Ignore my credentials; trust me, you don't. Granted, there are things that are across the board regardless of genre, sure. But PLEASE for the love of your career, choose someone who lives and breathes that genre!
Choose someone with music industry credentials, not just the freelancer who will do the job for the least amount of money. Be willing to pay for quality and industry-specific knowledge, please! For instance, I come to you as someone:-with Artist Management experience-with Booking Agent experience (in MUSIC)-with Producer Placement experience (A&R, major labels)-working on my MBA in Music Business (SNHU/Berklee College of Music, '21)-who is an Official Member of The Recording Academy (the GRAMMYs)-with a strong (A+ list) network of connections I'm personally acquainted or friends withYeah, it's CLOUT. But still, please don't choose someone to represent you or your brand if they don't even know what half of that clout even *means....

This concludes my TED Talk. Thank you.

	What has happened to the Clients' account? No reporting tools? And what has happened to support?
","May 9, 2021  10:03:32 PM","
I am a freelancer but also had a client's account. I haven't used my Client's account for the last 2 or 3 years. Recently, I wanted to hire some freelancers, so I switched to my client's account, created jobs and hired a few freelancers. But now I realise that all the essential reporting tools like reviewing the timesheets etc are not accessible anymore, unless I upgrade my account for $49/month. Also, there is no way to contact Upwork support. I can't find a contact form, or how to submit a new ticket, although I can find my old tickets - but there is no way to create a new one. So what's happening in Upwork recently?Isn't all the above restrictions an obstacle for clients? How can a client ""buy"" work or ""time"" from a freelancer, without knowing some details of the work and what he is about to pay at the end of the week?I, as a freelancer, am tracking time submitting timesheets... Do they have any value for my clients? *By the way: $49/month + freelancer pro account month fee + all fees on every transaction is a lot of money.

	Poor work quality, milestones not delivered
","May 9, 2021  10:59:13 AM","
Hello  I have been having a problem with the freelancer I am working withI was unforutnately unaware of the manual hours policy and feel ripped off.  The freelancer has input ALL their hours as manual and overcharged for the work.Additionally I the website is very slow, ranks very low in terms of website grading and is not optimized for mobile.There are many things that I was expecting the freelancer to be able to do such as integrating the payment gateway and now that we are knees deep into the project the freelancer said that they wont be able to do the task because ""they have never done this before""!. They have taken on alot of the deliverables that they dont seem to know how to do and I have been charged over $700 for a poor quality website when I was expecting to pay approximately half of that price. My main issue is that we are way past the deadline and have lost a significant amount of money doing so. I would like to launch the website ASAP but cannot because we arent able to finalize the website and its quality.I have attempted to communicate my concerns to the freelancer with no use.  I would like someone from upwork to review the hours with the quality of work and I cant seem to be able to get a hold of anybody; I have done a dispute and unfortunately its very difficult for me to communicate with the freelancer.

Hi, I used to be able to login to Upwork in Chrome with my google login, but now nothing happens when I hit the button for Google login. In the Upwork login screen, it doesn't say that popups are blocked. I also have popups allowed in Chrome Settings. I think this is an issue with the Upwork login screen, rather than just a Chrome issue, though I can login with Edge. Rather than spend more time on this issue, I would like to just get a direct password connected to my User rather than use Google. For that, I need to communicate with a live person. However, there does not appear to be any way to contact a live person with Upwork: as far as I can see, my only choices are the community forum and a chat bot.  Thanks,Tom

	Loose Money in Upwork
","Apr 7, 2021  12:24:07 AM","
I recently hired a fake or unprofessional freelancer. He was charging for doing something out of our work instruction. Eventhough if he did work according to our instruction, he ended up never giving the work nor proof of his works. I've been asking for his work evidence since 4 weeks which has passed by. On the other hand, Upwork has time limited of 4 weeks for dispute. In total, we lost money amounted charged $150 (on $4/hr rate). I can't imagine if he was charging at a much higher rate. So, I personally would want to pay higher to someone who has a unique skill/talent that I need as well as professional. But if he does not have any of that, why would a client pays these guys higher ? Why would a client pays a higher ammount on this platform to a replacedable freelancer where/whom you can pay to in a lower amount ? (asume SAME QUALITY!). p.sDo NOT correlate PRICE with QUALITY in this discussion !, because it is NOT correlated at all what so ever !  It's more about correlation in beetween of PRICE with UNIQUENESS !. So I hope upwork find more freelancers whom are tagged as unique to increase the platform's UX and income !

Hi everyone, I'm new on upwork and I'm not happy with the job of my freelancer. she had to find me some influencers and I told her to look about in in a specefic way because there is many fake and not good influencers. I'm just checking about what she did and isnt good I have a proof because I went to pay and download some report on other website to check about the first of them who as on my list. Could you please, advice me what can I do ? and also to reduce the amount I have to pay to the freelancer I hired because she didnt do her job properly. Thanks in advance. Cindy.

	Refund for pay for hour
","May 6, 2021  06:24:38 AM","
I had a contract with a freelancer and I had to cancel it after 20+ hours. The contract was dragging while 2 other freelancers hired for the same job finished their work. The freelancer said he needs 10+ more hours which is way too much for what I need. I ended up with no deliverables, nothing to show for and $360 lost. How do I get a refund for this?

There is one freelancer ""EXPERT"" that provides site speed solutions for a better SEO score.He deliberately inserts code that makes you think that he did everything right.At first look, it seems perfect and he easily charges 200$-400$ for few quick hours.For the long term, google WILL find the scam in the code and the clients of this freelancer will lose all of their SEO scores. Note- this freelancer uses bad code, and puts much effort to hide it. I was lucky to be spotted by a TRUE EXPERT to locate this scam! (it took him few hours) The worst thing is that I reported to upwork 2 days ago, and they did nothing (yet).this freelancer is still working and accepting 2-3 victims a week. Please help me to reach Upwork and stop this madness!

	Two-factor authentication for EU clients
","Apr 6, 2021  06:42:59 AM","
I have had a milestone declined today as MasterCard automatically declines all payments over 500 euro (roughly 590 dollars) from now on. Their response: Upwork as a platform does not comply with the EU directive called PSD2 which requires two-factor authentication to combat online fraud. Do any of you know if Upwork is going to comply with this in the future? To be fair, the milestone I had trouble with was approved once I split it up in two. But this is just a bit tiring and it's embarrasing not being able to pay freelancers on time.

	How to print an entire Upwork message thread
","Oct 27, 2015  07:15:07 AM","
As a client, I find the messages exchanged between myself and a hired freelancer something that should be preserved offline, either on paper, or as a PDF. The sometimes months of messages that are exchanged can be useful months or years later, if those messages contain details about the operation of a program that is being developed, for example. Things that may have been forgotten during the development can be reviewed if the project's message thread between the client and freelancer can be saved/printed/exported to the client's hard drive. Yet, despite what would seem to be an obvious need, I have failed to find any way to do just that. Simply using Firefox or Chrome's or IE's ""Print"" or ""Save As"" functions, you cannot get the ENTIRE message thread preserved offline. Why is this? Does it make sense to have no option of being able to refer back to an old project's communication/message thread other than by being connected to Upwork's Inbox?

I need either the email or phone number to the corporate office to file a complaint. I am in dispute with a freelancer that was hired to complete work that was agreed and signed by the freelancer prior to the start of the project. The freelancer has been paid and is now refusing to complete the work that was agreed to. I have spent approximately $10,000 or more with this agency as all part of this project only to find that the agency owner has backpeddled on many promises, late on all deliverables, not lived up to managing the project, and is now refusing to complete the development that was signed and agreed to. As a customer since this platform was o-desk, and having spent tens of thousands of dollars through this platform i will NOT accept anything short of total satisfaction including and up-to a refund from the freelancer along with the suspension of the freelancer. I have a legal team engaged should your company not be willing to participate in resolution. Please provide how i can formally escalate this issue.

	Payment method add failure

						Hi there! Two years ago- I have tried to use my credit card for helping my friend to buy connects for bidding in projects. But as the card holder name was different than upwork name, the payment method add request was declined. But there was no message stating that the payment method has been suspended. So, yesterday i tried to add my card in my upwork client account for hiring a freelancer but this time- it's showing that ""Our records indicate that the payment method entered is already associated with maximum number of accounts. Please add a different payment method"". Although my card isn't associated with any single upwork account regardless freelancer/client/agency -then why the system is showing this type of error?

	Can I ask my full-time freelancer to help me with personal work frequently
","Apr 30, 2021  02:27:02 AM","
I am a first-time employer, and recently hired a freelancer for a full-time job with the job title ""Need assistant for a monthly contract requiring stock trading/finance-related work"".In the job post, I said the job is assisting me in stock trading all day like tasks like research, tracking my portfolio all day long, sending me constant alerts related to my portfolio and market change, and grunt work related to trading.I also added a small point in the work description ""Any other personal assistance work.""Now I wonder where do I draw the line in personal assistance. I have many personal assistance tasks that I need frequently like ""Look who is a good doctor in my area for X health issue and book an appointment"", ""Call everyone and find who has this product available"", ""Look for best and cheap flight connection between these 2 countries"".Although part-time work, these tasks are completely unrelated to finance. I know a lot of white-collar workers don't like to do such thing and believe they are being treated like a servant.So my questions are:How do I know if my freelancer employee is okay with such work? I can try asking but I am not sure if he will say yes anyway since after all, I am his boss.

	Not able to delete ONLY client account
","Apr 25, 2018  02:07:06 PM","
I'm trying to delete only my client account. It has no members or active contracts.
 
The problem is that the link for account deletion in the Client settings section is the same for deleting the freelancer account.
A friend of mine who was new to Upwork accidentally created a client account for the first time. Then, he created a freelancer account and tried to delete the client account. What happened next is that all of his accounts were deleted.
 
The same is happening with me. The only difference is that I'm not able to delete my freelancer account because I have an open contract as freelancer.
 
Anyway, I'm not trying to delete my freelancer account, but the client account deletion link points to the wrong location.
 
As client
1. Select my client account in the upper right corner.
2. Go to Settings > My Info
3. Link for account deletion is https://www.upwork.com/UserSettings/profile/close-account
 
As freelancer
1. Select my freelancer account in the upper right corner.
2. Go to Settings > Contact Info
3. In the account info section, the link for closing account points to https://www.upwork.com/UserSettings/profile/close-account.
 
So, they're the same!! What's the correct link for deleting only my client account?

I want to make a complaint about a freelancer/agency **Edited for Community Guidelines** who repeatedly sent an app with so many bugs I wasn't able to determine that the functionality I had repeatedly explained was ignored and I'm not left with a phone app that doesn't work, is not fit for purpose and I'm out $2,900. He is a con artist and I want my money back.
 
I want to change my review to reflect the discovery of the fact that the app doesn't do as instructed.
 
I want to complain officially to upwork about this freelancer.
 
I want to get my money back. They quoted a few weeks, it has now been 9 months to complete it and I had to stop the contract before completion because upwork demanded another $600 be sent, which is a stupid system for when the money has not been sent because the app hasn't been completed.
 
Could anyone please advise how I might be able to do any/all of these?

	What's the point of mediation for hourly contract?
","Mar 29, 2021  11:07:37 AM","
I hired a freelancer to create an app and he promised to deliver in 100 hours. We started an hourly contract and throughout development he used various tactics to stall the development and get more hours (I'm not an app developer so his work logs didn't mean much to me). When he sent a broken app with multiple issues and broken functionality after 350 hours I filed a dispute only to learn that mediation can only help us ""reach agreement"" and that arbitration for hourly contracts is not available. 
 
Obviously we couldn't reach an agreement, that's why I filed a dispute in the first place. So the question is - what is the point of mediation for hourly contracts if it doesn't provide any remedy for broken agreements, stalling, and poor work overall? It only wasted time, as the mediation guy didn't respond for days and couldn't properly explain the process at any moment in private correspondence. But maybe that was because he didn't know much about it himself, as he initially said that arbitration is possible in our case before the freelancer corrected him (see attachment). 
 
I assumed that there would be more client protection for hourly contracts, considering it must bring more revenue to Upwork, while making the client more vulnerable with automatic payments. Now I see absolutely no sense in ever starting an hourly contract here.

Hi,I had hired a freelancer to work on a project, he said he had completed it succesfully and wanted the payment, he assured me it was a great project and he did everything as told, I was in work at this point so could not fully open what he had sent me so I truested him and sent the payment. After a few days I went back to the project to open, I see the whole project is a mess it is not what I had asked him to do and is a total nightmare I had messaged him nicely asked questions and no response whatsoever he is offline also and will not respond to me. I understand sometimes people take on things they can not complete but at least respond and explain sorry I could not do it 100% etc we are all people!! But I am very angry he has left me like this with no response and just took my money and I had given him a great review too.! this is very irresponsible and rude and I or anyone would not appreciate this. I have demanded a refund from him but still nothing, I'm not sure how to go about this now? how can I bring this further, no one needs more stress these days with everthing going on in our lives.

	Freelancer misrepresenting their skill level

						I'm kind of in a pickle right now, and I'm not sure how to move forward.I'm a client and have been for over five years here on Upwork. I've had lots of successful projects and have always trusted Upwork.I recently went through a pretty rigorous hiring process for a project (a motion graphics explainer video.) I received nearly a hundred proposals, read through and examined them all, and whittled my way down to the person I decided on. Their portfolio was incredible and I was excited to work with them. We exchanged many messages, storyboards, mood boards, and examples, and the freelancer assured me they understood everything and would be able to deliver the entire video within 5 business days. Weeks went by, and he gave reasons why it wasn't done yet. I'm a freelance animator myself, so I totally get it, and wanted to be flexible, so I was.Then, today, he sent me a rough draft of the first animation slide (there are ~30 slides total,) and it wasn't even in the same universe, when it comes to quality, as his work that he shared in his ""portfolio"". Like I said, I'm a freelancer as well myself, and it was obvious this guy didn't create the work in his alleged portfolio. I was confused though, because his ratings were good, and he had an 80% job success rating for his past work – much of which was animated explainer videos.I confronted him about it and asked directly, and he said it would be fixed. He also admitted to having an illustrator and animator working under him, so I guess he's a mock agency or something? I totally get sub-contracting, I do it myself sometimes, and am fine with it, but I feel like he just pulled those videos in his portfolio from somewhere else to attract clients like me.The problem with all of this is the fact that we agreed to a project-rate with three milestones. We've already passed two of those and I've paid him half of the project's budget for just the storyboard he sent to me illustrating that he sort of understood the direction I wanted the video to head.But now, with the animations, they're wayyyy off, and appear to not be not done by the same animator, and I feel cheated.Am I just toast at this point? I mean, I feel like it's pretty dishonest to represent yourself as something and then not be able to deliver on what was agreed upon. Have any other clients out there dealt with something like this before? Do you have any advice for me? Should I try to reach out to Upwork? Is there any hope for me to receive a (even a partial) refund?

	Messaging Multiple Freelancers
","Oct 16, 2015  11:10:19 AM","
Right now, there doesn't appear to be any option to send a message to multiple freelancers at once. The only option that comes close is adding multiple freelancers to a 'Room.' But doing so would allow all people in the room to interact with one another - this is NOT something I'm looking for. I simply want a way to communicate a quick request to multiple freelancers at one time. Right now, in order to send a work request for content, I must individually look up every freelancer by name, enter the message in their private 'Room,' then go onto the next. It's unbelievably time consuming and tedious. There should be a way to add multiple freelancers into a group 'folder' or something of the like, to allow me to send a group message without having them all be able to have a group conversation. I want the conversations to remain one on one, as they are now. Just the option to send a message to multiple users at once.

	relationships with the client after fixed-price work done
","Apr 25, 2021  06:56:44 AM","
Hi.Am I correct that after a client paid me for a fixed-priced project It means he accepted the work and he could use the result of this work at his own risk and peril. Am I responsible as a freelancer for the bugs in the software which might appear in the future after the work was delivered? What should I do if the client will blame me for this? It looks like the client I am working with didn't check the result of the work well enough and he wrote me after around a week I got paid: ""We made a mistake with trusting you to provide us with correct and truthful information... I am not angry at you. I made some promises on when we would start to other people"" I made a typo when answering the client's question about work results and it might be prevented if the client checked the result of work.  One more thing. The client asks for endless fixes and asks too many questions. He misrepresented his skills in python. He couldn't even install packages and instead of using google tell me to fix this type of thing very insolently and impolitely. He tried to call me at midnight without making an arrangement.I've already done for them by far more than they paid for and wouldn't like to hurt my reputation with a bad review but would like to stop these frustrating relationships. Could you give me advice, please? Thank you!

	Beware clients: time tracker is over charging you... like crazy!
","Oct 27, 2015  08:15:58 AM","
Ok... so this is what happened. I just started my first hourly contract on Upwork (I just migrated here from Elance) so it was my first time using the tracker. Yesterday I could see that on the real time tracker (the top part) it showed 5 minutes but below (total time for the day) it already showed 20 minutes. And believe me, I was very aware I had started 5 minutes ago... Today I started working and I had been working for 29 minutes, when it already showed 40. So I contacted customer support. Their answer is that it charges in 10 minutes blocks, which would make sense... but there is a trick. If you start at 11:59... you would believe it will charge another 10 minutes at: 12:09... but it doesn't! It does not track 10 minutes blocks in real time. It takes 10 minutes blocks by the clock... but this I mean: If you start at 11:59 it already charges you 10 minutes for the block corresponding to 11:50 to 12 PM. And if you click Stop at 12:01 it charges you another 10 minutes for the block corresponding to 12:00 to 12:10... so you end up paying for 20 minutes instead of 3. Now imagine if that happens 3 times in a day, you are already paying 1 extra hour. Now what if some one does that (not necessarily on purpose) more than 3 times a day? Which is possible... After a long discussion, this is customer service's conclusion (literal): ""It shouldn't be a big different in the time."" For you!! Because you don't have to pay for it. Imagine what this means for freelancers with the highest hourly rates!! Also multipy this for every freelancer in the platform, working around the globe, 24/7.... it's a lot of money!!! that goes to automatic payment! Needless to say: I have never and I'll never over-charge a client, so I'll talk to him about not using the tracker... But this is crazy!!! I'm not sure whether to laugh or cry....

	Ripped Off, I paid for A website Redesign They deleted the job and took the money.
","Apr 25, 2021  01:12:32 AM","
HI there, i just want to know what can i do in the case of these freelancer from agency that i hired for a job, the worst thing that i made is paying a web redesign based in hourly rate.anyways the case is that they were making a poor job, slowly process, they told me that it will took 40-45 hours trusting on these guys believing they were about to do an incredible job, WRONG.They took 12 hours for 8usd rate, they were doing just copy paste for the original page that i have, images they already had from the examples that they gave me to see how could be the page, when i requested something original based on these examples obviously, ripped off, i asked a refund , they say no , ok i opened a dispute, the dispute team gave them the case, Conclusion after all that they deleted the work, they dont even let the backup of images themes, just nothing and they took all my money.The dispute team just took in case that Per Upwork's user agreement the client, not Upwork, is responsible for managing and maintaining the quality of work. oh yeah what about that they deleted the work.I felt scammed in every way because at the first that i was negotiating about the redesign they insisted in the hourly rate just when i was saying that is better in fixed price, but i trusted on them, they know how the system works, BEWARE of this, anybody can do a scam with these because in fact they will win the case using the norms in their favor. Now i have another week billed that i have to dispute with this poor team from upwork too, ridiculous.I mean i like upwork, but they dont care, they dont see the facts. Any help to what to do in the next week bill that i have to pay to these scammers will be helpful.

	Plagiarism expiring after 30 days?
","Apr 24, 2021  03:52:50 AM","
Hi, So first off, I'd like to say I've been a very happy upwork customer for years. I've hired dozens of freelancers to write articles articles, and I learned to stay away from those who aren't good at writing content and aren't experts in their field. Until now. Native English speaker freelancer, experienced in her field - just what I needed. It was her first job, but we all have to start somewhere, right? The way she communicated was perfect. No red flags. She writes 11 articles, when I get the idea to use copyscape. Yes, I should ahve done it sooner. Most articles are ok, except for one that's 66% plagiarized, and another one that's 30%. Of course, in reality, the percentages are higher because she changed some of the wording. I was in shock. We already had a milestone in progress that was funded and she delivered work, and I was just about to approve it when thsi happened. The funny part? The 30% article she spun belonged another website of mine. And before you ask, yes, Wayback Machine took a spanshot  of the article after I published it last year, before the two of us met. The other article belongs to a high profile website in my niche. I can't imagine the damages to that website I would have had to pay if I had published the article. It's almost identical. Her reaction to all of this? Shrugging her shoulders. She can't understand what happened. She didn't copy paste. Maybe she reproduced the thing unconsciouscly afte reading the sources for inspiration. She is quite the prodigy. She never tried to figure out what happened. Just shrugged her shoulders saying ""it wasn't me"". Veery quiet about it, letting time pass by, while sometimes replying to my messages,  leading me to believe ther's progress and that we can work it out. Not surpising for someone who ""used to be a laywer"".I've been trying to work something out with her for 3 weeks now. She's very good at stalling, though she does reply, so she's not sick. I asked for refunds for the articles (a partial one for the partially plagiarized article) but she did not reply to them. She said she will have something ""asap"" but didn't. Last night I found a 3rd article with issues, and requested a small refund for. Thankfully only had one paragraph plagiarized. She offered it this morning ""as a gesture of goodwill"". A gesture of goodwill after she refuses to refund me an 8X larger amount of money for the other two articles, and after she's purposefully stalling for weeks. And the worst part? We still have a milestone for an article that passes copyscape that I have to pay. It's roughly the same amoune as what I am owed for the plagiarized content. And it seems I have to pay it.Upwork, what is happening? 30 days, really? Do crimes expire after 30 days? Yes, I should have done it sooner. But only 30 days to get a refund for a piece of content that is an obvious scam? As a client spending money here, that doesn't make me feel very safe. Please change your policies. I'm not coming back after 7 years (even though in front of the law I can), I'm coming back after a few months. Another fair optionfor UpWork would be to start suspending such accounts. The evidence is there. It doesn't matter whether you refund the money or not. These are not the kind of people you want on your platform. Thanks, Ovi

	UpWork invoices are not compliant for EU
","Apr 4, 2021  01:42:38 PM","
Hey everyone,I am a EU based client and I hired someone for a certain project. Project is proceeding quite well. Problem which I have is that my Finance department is not satisfied with invoices which we receive from UpWork. For hourly based work each week we receive 3 pdfs:- receipt, seems fine, it contains total amount for processing fee and actual work- invoice for payment processing fee (3%), which is okay (screenshot attached)- invoice for actual work and this one is not okay (screenshot attached)The ""from"" section is populated with personal data (name, surname, address) of a guy which I hired via UpWork. This it just wrong. This is an invalid invoice under our legislation and I can not submit it further. Invoice comes from UpWork and it is paid to UpWork meaning that ""from"" section should be populated with their data. Just the same way as it is in processing fee invoice.I bet I am not the only one with this problem. I am just wondering how you guys solved this?Thank you for any answer!Marko

Dear all, As we are new on Upwork we had recently hired a developer. But she didnt did anything on our website.

But as we had stop the project in the middle of week we were charged again for the other days. But this time the freelancer rejected our refund and we filed a dispute but the customer service went through her work diary and they only refunded us $8. We had an existing website. Instead of working on our website and the task we asked for the freelancer did the contrary and messed up our website completely. How do we ask Upwork for refund of the remaining.

	I requested a dispute from a freelancer as I was completely mislead.
","Apr 17, 2021  07:27:18 AM","
Hey everyone,  As per the subject line, I've officially experienced my first awful encounter with a freelancer. My job description was clearly trying to vet a designer to fulfill my click funnels landing page and essentially revamp what I currently had. The job posting was clear as day. The freelancer's profile intrigued me, so I got on a call with him. Now, no harm to anyone but this gentleman was from Moldova and had very broken English and he APPARENTLY pitched me a consulting for a whopping $1000 USD whereas I thought it would be the actual work. I got on the second call with him and asked him when the design process would actually begin and he said he would create the design, and only assist with how the design should be. The call consisted of him sharing his screen showing us different options on how to execute our landing page design, customer persona, etc. [Everything in the call was stuff I already knew, I needed execution]. Wholeheartedly, I really feel like I got scammed. I can't believe this is actually happening. This payment is as follows: April 6: Escrow of $10000April 12: First call (1 hr) - My team confused as the ""consulting"" was out of expectation and even then, he did a horrible job. April 16: Second call (20 min because we realized we were being scammed) April 16: Dispute It's a fixed job, not hourly. Note: The freelancer will only give me back $400 USD and I of course am requesting the full amount. Can Upwork enforce the full amount back to me without going to arbitration?

	Can't make payment
","Apr 20, 2020  01:02:05 PM","
My PayPal payment to a freelancer was rejected because my credit card, which is my primary payment method for PayPal, blocked the payment as suspicious. I have now marked the transaction as not suspicious, but I can't re-try paying in Upwork, because Upwork won't let me re-attempt through PayPal. Apparently you only get one chance? The only reason I'm paying through PayPal is because you won't accept my Revolut Business Mastercard, simply because it's a prepaid card? So I am stuck and would like to pay this freelancer, because she's doing great work and I value the relationship. Very frustrating, and after an hour of trying to make sense of your customer support system, I'm ready to pull my hair out. Please assist me in running my payment through PayPal a second time now that the payment is no longer marked as suspicious. Thank you.Bradford Goodwin

Hi,  I am a client located in India, and am working with freelancers based in India also. I am making payments through my credit card. However, the invoices that are generated by Upwork are in USD. Is it possible for me to get invoices in INR? TDS: As I understand, anyway I shall need to gross up and pay TDS (as upwork does not allow any deduction), but for that I shall need the Freelancers' PAN number. How can i get that in the invoice? GST:  GST is not added,a. if the invoice is in USD I shall need to pay GST directly to the govt (reverse charge mechanism), and then claim setoffb while if it is in INR, and from a non-registered freelancer, then no GST is added in Invoice Also, if the invoice is in INR then i suppose it will not be considered as a foreign remittance so i shall not need to file Form 15CA/CB? Anyone here having experience with this, do please suggest.Thanks very much,Vivek

	Fraud
","Apr 15, 2021  05:08:05 PM","
There is more than just academic fraud - there is straight up fraud!
I recently hired someone to create some content for an online course I am creating and specified I was looking for someone with native or fluent in English, they provided their proof of work which was a thesis in perfect English.
I hired them because they had a masters in Psychology and that is along the lines of the work I do.
I asked them to read 3 pages of a document and summarise it for kids to understand and I got half a page of bullet points with images so small they couldn't be read and emoji's (in a professional document) and it was completely off topic and all in broken English.
My 6 year old son could tell the sentances didn't make sense!!!!!!!
 
I was vchared 10 hourse to find and resize 10 images - when I agreed to 1 or 2 and to convert a word doc to a PDF.... 10 hours???
She also continued to bill me after I told her I didn't want her to continue as I was unhappy with the work and then agaon after I cancelled the contract.
I have been told that upwork can't decide to refund or not, it is at the complete discression on the hiree - why would someone conducting fraud refund money?
 
I was billed 35 hours in total = $525
Do you think that is a reasonable price to read 3 pages and summarise them into half a page????
I think not!
 
Upwork your operating processes and extremely questionable and unlawful!
I am under the impression that a company cannot willingly allow someone to conduct fraud within their business - regardless of the T&C's - the law trumps your T&C's.
 
Unfortunately it was only after I used your platform, that I found a number of fraudulent complaints about you online and most of these have gone unresolved.
 
You need to start taking these things seriously, what you are doing is illegal!

I told her that I'm paying 30$ just for her to finish it since I already took from her time as she said. she told me that's ok and closed the meeting while I'm talking!!!!! Today morning she sent me a msg here that she won't do anything and will open a dispute if I didn't pay her work that I didn't benefit from at all

	Upwork team has allowed a Freelancer Fraud despite being given evidence
","Apr 3, 2021  10:44:23 AM","
Upwork website offers to connect customers with a “trusted independent provider”, to find “the right talent” for customers, to connect customers with “professionals”, saying that the talents provided are “reviewed” and are “trusted experts” as well as other promises that make customers feel that they are protected and that Upwork environment is safe. As a client, I relied on these presentations and commitments when I used their services and engaged one of their translators for a single translation work in August 2020. However, and to my great dismay, I discovered that I was fraudulently billed additional sums of money, accumulating to thousands of US$.I contacted Upwork and they in turn, rightfully requested the freelancer to provide proof of communication with me, or any other kind of proof that she has performed any kind of work whatsoever for me after August 22, 2020. Not surprisingly, the translator was not able to do so, falsely claiming that she was bound to some “terms of license” and could therefore not provide proof of the work she claims to have performed. No proof of existence of any such perported “terms of licence” was provided. Furthermore, I informed both her and Upwork that I am waiving any privilege I might have and am authorizing the translator to provide any writings, documents or communications that she claims to have had with me to Upwork. However, the translator was still unable to provide any shred of proof of the claimed work she had purportedly performed.  Please note, that the translator’s claim, as if she is bound by some “terms of license” that do not permit her to disclose communications with a client, and that, furthermore, those purported terms are not waivable, is false as well as absurd. First, no such terms exist in her profession and there is no “translator privilege”. Second, even the highly protected communications between an attorney and his or her client are easily discoverable once a client waives his privilege.  The translator’s claim that she cannot provide you proof of the work she claims to have performed due to some “terms of license” is clearly a feeble excuse. It is as clear as can be that the translator did not perform any kind of work for me after the single August 22, 2020 task. By using Upwork services and the platform they offer she was able to defraud me of thousands of US$.In light of Upwork commitment to their clients, to the fact that they have negligently listed a fraud on their website - a website which promises secure transactions to its clients, that they negligently dealt with the billing inquiry I had made back in October 2020 about this, I still continued to be fraudulently charged on a monthly basis. My requests that Upwork provide me with the full personal details of the translator, including proof that she is indeed a certified translator, so that I may take appropriate steps against her were ignored and the case was closed leaving me short of thousands of US$. Should anyone want to know more details you are welcome to contact me.Thank you Upwork for your ""proffesional service"".

	Double Billing from Upwork
","Apr 15, 2021  02:04:30 PM","
Hi,Has anyone ever noticed that they were charged twice on their credit card statement for a single invoice? I can't find anywhere in Upwork where I can make a dispute on this. My freelancer (hourly) was paid once on this single invoice, but I have a credit card statment with the same charge twpo weeks apart. No other payment has been doubled, and all the other weekly invoices line up with the credit card statement. How do I fight this and get a refund? Please and thanks for any advice on how to find a human to support. The Upwork bot can't seem to understand my concern, and filing a dispute wont work since the freelancer was paid correctly.

	How to file formal complaint against Freelancer once contract has ended?
","Apr 13, 2021  11:44:19 AM","
To Whom it May concern,  I ran into this issue on Upwork once before but unfortunately fell victim to it this time around. I contracted a 3D designer via the Upwork network based upon his rating. We contracted for a 3D product design on Upwork and he completed it on time. The next day, he suggested I have him build the prototype on his company contract off Upwork as it would save him fees and he could save me money. I knew this wasn't proper however, based upon the discount he gave, I agreed. I gave him 50% upfront and he spent 2 weeks building the prototype and sent me an invoice for the remainig 50% prior to shipping. I told him I'd send the remainder once I inspected the prototype. He said this was not the industry custom and I should send the remainder first. I refused and eventually he sent the prototype. To my disappointment my suspicion was correct...not only did the not prototype work (which means the 3D files he created via Upwork are useless), he attmepted to glue the 3D printed model back together in places where it had broken. He knew the prototype was defective weeks ago which means he knew his 3D/CAD design was faulty. Instead of saying this to me, he attempted to defraud me on the contract hoping I'd pay everything and then he would have the money free and clear. I tried texting him and asked for him to either re-do the design/prototype for free or refund the money in full. He has since blocked me from Upwork messages. But he left me a Client Review on Upwork that read, ""Great Client!"". LOL...great sucker more like it.I know Upwork won't be able to get my money back and I intend to let small claims/civil court do that. My question is: how can I file a formal complaint against this freelancer so that he is blacklisted from this site and isn't able to take advantage of another client here? (And he won't be able to use Upwork as his platform to go fishing for clients avoiding their fee service) Thank You. - (Pics of Cheap 3D prototype with glued broken pieces attached)3 glued pieces. One broke offBroken pieces of prototype. Cheap materials. Freelancer wanted $2544 total for this.

	Mislead by ""Architect"" am I protected?
","Apr 14, 2021  12:56:24 PM","
Hi everyone, I am new to UpWork and getting increasingly frustrated. I recently signed up to hire an architect and engineer on here to do drawings and MEP work for a new restaurant buildout of mine for a new construction lease I signed. I want to be as up front as possible, this is an all new startup and I have no experience with going into business so unfortunately a lot is trial and error so far. I was up front about my ignorance and naivity to both the Engineer and Architect, I even arranged a conference call with them before offering a contract so I could just make sure what details were needed for my buildout was understood and I wasn't missing anything that I need for a FL commercial space. This architect who shows a Masters in Architecture on their profile, as well as many open contracts and assured me he has experience in FL for commercial AND specifically restaurants but could not send those works due to non-disclosure. Again, my naivity if that is not an industry standard. Anyways, I paid half of the job already when he produced the first couple drawings but had many errors and typos that needed correcting which furthered this process. He did tell my engineer in the beginning that he was not FL licensed and was awaiting it, but was working under a licensed architect and lead us on to believe that architect would seal the plans, over a month later and his ""complete"" plans are useless since he can't seal them. I do NOT wish to pay him the remainder and I feel extremely mislead given how honest I was about my ignorance to the overall process. Being unfamiliar with this platform, I trusted UpWork freelancers were vetted to some degree or verified, but it appears thats not the case. Makes me terrified to ever use a freelance platform again. Does UpWork protect any of its clients with this or is it a free for all on here with the honor system?

	Freelancer outsourced the job to someone else? (to a non english speaker, work terrible) money lost?
","May 7, 2021  11:58:14 PM","
Hi. I am having a lot of issues at the moment with some work that recently got 'completed'. I am in disbelief at how this has been handled so far. I paid an individual freelancer $400 to complete a webpage. I left instructions and videos on what was required. The work was 'completed' numerous times. But ridden with errors every time. It was taking me longer to find and correct the careless errors than it would've done to complete the work myself.It turns out the freelancer has outsourced the work to non-English speakers that had a hard time reading and implementing what was required.A month late we still don't have a finished product, and the freelancer outsourced the work wasting time and energy.Now with the dispute... I have been told that I need to spend $300 for arbitration to have a 'chance' of getting my money back? Spending an additional $300 to get back the $400? This is absurd. The freelancer was a month late, outsourced the work, didn't complete the work and wants full payments plus I have to pay an additional $300 to challenge this? What is the best option here, I cannot believe this whole situation. Freelancer clearly violated TOS by outsourcing right? Plus the work is incomplete after me spending hours on revisions guidance etc. Would love to hear your thoughts.
